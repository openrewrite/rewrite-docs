# Spring

The [rewrite-spring](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring/) module provides recipes and visitors which automate three themes:

* [Spring](https://spring.io/) hygiene and best practices
* Migration from [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 1.x to 2.x
* Migration from [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) 1.x to 3.x 

Mockito migration may look out of place in this list as Mockito isn't related to Spring. Spring boot packages Mockito for testing, and between Spring 1 and 2 it went from using Mockito 1 to Mockito 3. Most Spring boot 1 to 2 migrations will involve upgrading Mockito. It is possible to apply the mockito recipes to non-Spring projects to facilitate Mockito migrations unrelated to Spring Boot.

This functionality is being actively developed. If you are aware of something we've missed or find a bug, [file an issue](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring/issues) and let us know.

### Use in the [Rewrite Maven Plugin](../../configuring/rewrite-maven-plugin/)

To apply these recipes and visitors in the Maven plugin, add a `provided` scope dependency on `rewrite-spring` and activate pre-packaged recipes or define your own.
