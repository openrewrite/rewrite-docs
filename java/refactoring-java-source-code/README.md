# Transforming Java Code

Rewrite provides a set of basic building blocks to transform Java code which can be composed into higher-level transformations. These are detailed in the subsequent pages and include:

* Add annotation to a class, method, or variable.
* Add a field to a class.
* Add/remove an import, which can be configured to expand/collapse star imports.
* Change field name \(including its references, even across other source files that _use_ this field not just where the field is defined\).
* Change a field type.
* Change a literal expression.
* Change a method name, including anywhere that method is referenced.
* Change a method target to a static from instance method.
* Change a method target to an instance method from a static.
* Change a type reference, anywhere it is found in the tree.
* Insert/delete method arguments.
* Delete any statement.
* Generate constructors using fields.
* Rename a variable.
* Reorder method arguments.
* Unwrap parentheses.
* Implement an interface.
* Order declarations.
* Order imports.

Each one of these operations is defined as a `JavaRefactorVisitor`designed for mutating the AST, ultimately leading to a `Change` object at the end of the refactoring operation.
