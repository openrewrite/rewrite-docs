# ChangeType

### Java Definition

`ChangeType` changes type references anywhere they occur \(variable declarations, generic parameters, return types, class extension/implementation, etc. It also corrects any import statements as necessary.

```java
Iterable<J.CompilationUnit> cus;

ChangeType ct = new ChangeType();
ct.setType("java.util.List");
ct.setTargetType("java.util.Collection");

Collection<Change> changes = new Refactor().visit(ct).fix(cus);
```

* `type` - The fully qualified type name that should be changed.
* `targetType` - The fully qualified type name to change to.

The type name doesn't have to be fully qualified in the source code to match. Rewrite looks at the type attributed to a particular identifier in the source code to see whether it represents the type that should change.
