# Modernize a Jenkins plugin to the latest versions supported by Java 8

**org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8**

_This recipe is intended to break down the modernization of very old plugins into distinct steps. It allows modernizing all tooling up to the last versions that supported Java 8. This can then be followed by another recipe that makes the jump to Java 11._

## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:0.13.0` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed): 
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:0.13.0")
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gradle init script" %}
1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.
{% code title="init.gradle" %}
```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:6.23.3") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:0.13.0")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8")
        exportDatatables = true
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run the recipe.
{% code title="shell" overflow="wrap"%}
```shell
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven POM" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-jenkins</artifactId>
            <version>0.13.0</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maven Command Line" %}

You will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" overflow="wrap" %}
```shell
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:RELEASE -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8 -Drewrite.exportDatatables=true
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe ModernizePluginForJava8
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
