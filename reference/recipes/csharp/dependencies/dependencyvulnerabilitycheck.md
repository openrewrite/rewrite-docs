# Find and fix vulnerable Nuget dependencies

**org.openrewrite.csharp.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

* version: 1.18.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `Boolean` | addMarkers | *Optional*. Report each vulnerability as search result markers. When enabled you can see which dependencies are bringing in vulnerable transitives in the diff view. By default these markers are omitted, making it easier to see version upgrades within the diff. |  |


## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.18.0` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed): 
{% tabs %}


{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe DependencyVulnerabilityCheck
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Data Tables

### Vulnerability report
**org.openrewrite.csharp.dependencies.table.VulnerabilityReport**

_A vulnerability report that includes detailed information about the affected artifact and the corresponding CVEs._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CVE | The CVE number. |
| Package name | The package name. |
| Version | The resolved version. |
| Fixed in version | The minimum version that is no longer vulnerable. |
| Fixable with version update only | Whether the vulnerability is likely to be fixed by increasing the dependency version only, with no code modifications required. This is a heuristic which assumes that the dependency is accurately versioned according to [semver](https://semver.org/). |
| Summary | The summary of the CVE. |
| Base score | The calculated base score. |
| Depth | Zero for direct dependencies. |
| CWEs | Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers; semicolon separated. |

### Source files that had results
**org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileResults**

_Source files that were modified by the recipe run._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path before the run | The source path of the file before the run. `null` when a source file was created during the run. |
| Source path after the run | A recipe may modify the source path. This is the path after the run. `null` when a source file was deleted during the run. |
| Parent of the recipe that made changes | In a hierarchical recipe, the parent of the recipe that made a change. Empty if this is the root of a hierarchy or if the recipe is not hierarchical at all. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
**org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileErrors**

_The details of all errors produced by a recipe run._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path | The file that failed to parse. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Stack trace | The stack trace of the failure. |

### Recipe performance
**org.openrewrite.table.RecipeRunStats**

_Statistics used in analyzing the performance of recipes._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The recipe | The recipe whose stats are being measured both individually and cumulatively. |
| Source file count | The number of source files the recipe ran over. |
| Source file changed count | The number of source files which were changed in the recipe run. Includes files created, deleted, and edited. |
| Cumulative scanning time | The total time spent across the scanning phase of this recipe. |
| 99th percentile scanning time | 99 out of 100 scans completed in this amount of time. |
| Max scanning time | The max time scanning any one source file. |
| Cumulative edit time | The total time spent across the editing phase of this recipe. |
| 99th percentile edit time | 99 out of 100 edits completed in this amount of time. |
| Max edit time | The max time editing any one source file. |
