## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | packagePattern | Package glob pattern used to match dependencies. | `Microsoft*` |
| `String` | newVersion | An exact version number. | `12.3` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample
displayName: Upgrade C# dependency versions example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.csharp.dependencies.UpgradeDependencyVersion:
      packagePattern: Microsoft*
      newVersion: 12.3
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.19.0 in your build file:
{% tabs %}


{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe UpgradeDependencyVersionExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
