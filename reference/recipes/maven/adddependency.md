# Add Maven dependency

**org.openrewrite.maven.AddDependency**

_Add a Maven dependency to a `pom.xml` file in the correct scope based on where it is used._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-maven/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/maven/AddDependency.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-maven/8.35.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-maven
* version: 8.35.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | groupId | The first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. | `com.google.guava` |
| `String` | artifactId | The second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. | `guava` |
| `String` | version | An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `String` | scope | *Optional*. A scope to use when it is not what can be inferred from usage. Most of the time this will be left empty, but is used when adding a runtime, provided, or import dependency. Valid options: `import`, `runtime`, `provided` | `runtime` |
| `Boolean` | releasesOnly | *Optional*. Whether to exclude snapshots from consideration when using a semver selector |  |
| `String` | onlyIfUsing | *Optional*. Used to determine if the dependency will be added and in which scope it should be placed. | `org.junit.jupiter.api.*` |
| `String` | type | *Optional*. The type of dependency to add. If omitted Maven defaults to assuming the type is "jar". Valid options: `jar`, `pom`, `war` | `jar` |
| `String` | classifier | *Optional*. A Maven classifier to add. Most commonly used to select shaded or test variants of a library | `test` |
| `Boolean` | optional | *Optional*. Set the value of the `<optional>` tag. No `<optional>` tag will be added when this is `null`. |  |
| `String` | familyPattern | *Optional*. A pattern, applied to groupIds, used to determine which other dependencies should have aligned version numbers. Accepts '*' as a wildcard character. | `com.fasterxml.jackson*` |
| `Boolean` | acceptTransitive | *Optional*. Default false. If enabled, the dependency will not be added if it is already on the classpath as a transitive dependency. | `true` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddDependencyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddDependencyExample
displayName: Add Maven dependency example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.AddDependency:
      groupId: com.google.guava
      artifactId: guava
      version: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
      scope: runtime
      onlyIfUsing: org.junit.jupiter.api.*
      type: jar
      classifier: test
      familyPattern: com.fasterxml.jackson*
      acceptTransitive: true
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.AddDependencyExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.AddDependencyExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe AddDependencyExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
