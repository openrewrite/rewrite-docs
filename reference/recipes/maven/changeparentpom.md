_Change the parent pom of a Maven pom.xml. Identifies the parent pom to be changed by its groupId and artifactId._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-maven/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/maven/ChangeParentPom.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-maven/8.35.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-maven
* version: 8.35.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | oldGroupId | The group ID of the Maven parent pom to be changed away from. | `org.springframework.boot` |
| `String` | newGroupId | *Optional*. The group ID of the new maven parent pom to be adopted. If this argument is omitted it defaults to the value of `oldGroupId`. | `org.springframework.boot` |
| `String` | oldArtifactId | The artifact ID of the maven parent pom to be changed away from. | `spring-boot-starter-parent` |
| `String` | newArtifactId | *Optional*. The artifact ID of the new maven parent pom to be adopted. If this argument is omitted it defaults to the value of `oldArtifactId`. | `spring-boot-starter-parent` |
| `String` | newVersion | An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. | `29.X` |
| `String` | oldRelativePath | *Optional*. The relativePath of the maven parent pom to be changed away from. | `../../pom.xml` |
| `String` | newRelativePath | *Optional*. New relative path attribute for parent lookup. | `../pom.xml` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `Boolean` | allowVersionDowngrades | *Optional*. If the new parent has the same group/artifact, this flag can be used to only upgrade the version if the target version is newer than the current. |  |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeParentPomExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeParentPomExample
displayName: Change Maven parent example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.ChangeParentPom:
      oldGroupId: org.springframework.boot
      newGroupId: org.springframework.boot
      oldArtifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
      newArtifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
      newVersion: 29.X
      oldRelativePath: ../../pom.xml
      newRelativePath: ../pom.xml
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeParentPomExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ChangeParentPomExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe ChangeParentPomExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
