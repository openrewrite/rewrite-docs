# Change Maven Project Version

**org.openrewrite.maven.ChangeProjectVersion**

_Change the project version of a Maven pom.xml. Identifies the project to be changed by its groupId and artifactId. If the version is defined as a property, this recipe will only change the property value if the property exists within the same pom._

| `String` | groupId | The group ID of the maven project to change its version. This can be a glob expression. | `org.openrewrite` |
| `String` | artifactId | The artifact ID of the maven project to change its version. This can be a glob expression. | `*` |

| `Boolean` | overrideParentVersion | *Optional*. This flag can be set to explicitly override the inherited parent version. Default `false`. |  |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeProjectVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeProjectVersionExample
displayName: Change Maven Project Version example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.ChangeProjectVersion:
      groupId: org.openrewrite
      artifactId: '*'
      newVersion: 8.4.2
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeProjectVersionExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ChangeProjectVersionExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe ChangeProjectVersionExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
