**org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradePluginVersion**

_Upgrade the version of a plugin using Node Semver advanced range selectors, allowing more precise control over version updates to patch or minor releases._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-maven/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/maven/UpgradePluginVersion.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-maven/8.35.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-maven
* version: 8.35.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | groupId | The first part of a dependency coordinate 'org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:VERSION'. Supports globs. | `org.openrewrite.maven` |
| `String` | artifactId | The second part of a dependency coordinate 'org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:VERSION'. Supports globs. | `rewrite-maven-plugin` |
| `String` | newVersion | An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. You can also use `latest.release` for the latest available version and `latest.patch` if the current version is a valid semantic version. For more details, you can look at the documentation page of [version selectors](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/dependency-version-selectors) | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `Boolean` | trustParent | *Optional*. Even if the parent suggests a version that is older than what we are trying to upgrade to, trust it anyway. Useful when you want to wait for the parent to catch up before upgrading. The parent is not trusted by default. |  |
| `Boolean` | addVersionIfMissing | *Optional*. If the plugin is missing a version, add the latest release. Defaults to false. |  |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradePluginVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradePluginVersionExample
displayName: Upgrade Maven plugin version example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradePluginVersion:
      groupId: org.openrewrite.maven
      artifactId: rewrite-maven-plugin
      newVersion: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradePluginVersionExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.UpgradePluginVersionExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe UpgradePluginVersionExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
