## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | groupId | The first part of a managed dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. | `com.google.guava` |
| `String` | artifactId | The second part of a managed dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. | `guava` |
| `String` | scope | *Optional*. Only remove managed dependencies if they are in this scope. If `runtime`, this willalso remove managed dependencies in the 'compile' scope because `compile` dependencies are part of the runtime dependency set. Valid options: `compile`, `test`, `runtime`, `provided` | `compile` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.RemoveManagedDependencyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.RemoveManagedDependencyExample
displayName: Remove Maven managed dependency example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.RemoveManagedDependency:
      groupId: com.google.guava
      artifactId: guava
      scope: compile
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.RemoveManagedDependencyExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.RemoveManagedDependencyExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe RemoveManagedDependencyExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
