## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration parameters and comes from a rewrite core library. It can be activated directly without adding any dependencies.
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.FindDeserializationErrors")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gradle init script" %}
1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.
{% code title="init.gradle" %}
```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:latest.release") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite:rewrite-java")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.FindDeserializationErrors")
        exportDatatables = true
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run the recipe.
{% code title="shell" overflow="wrap"%}
```shell
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven POM" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.FindDeserializationErrors</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maven Command Line" %}

You will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" overflow="wrap"%}
```shell
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.FindDeserializationErrors -Drewrite.exportDatatables=true
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe FindDeserializationErrors
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Data Tables

### Deserialization errors
**org.openrewrite.table.DeserializationErrorTable**

_Table collecting any LST deserialization errors._

| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path | The source that failed to be deserialized. |
| Error message | The error message of the exception that produced the error. |
| Stack trace | The stack trace of the error. |
| Language | Language of source file in case it requires a newer CLI version for the ingestion. |
| Minimum CLI version required by language | Minimum CLI version required to be able to successfully ingest sources of this language. |
| Actual CLI version used for ingestion | Actual CLI version used to ingest this source. |
| Timestamp (epoch millis) | UTC timestamp describing when the LST was produced, in milliseconds since the unix epoch. |
| Timestamp | UTC timestamp describing when the LST was produced, in ISO-8601 format. e.g.: "2023‐08‐07T22:24:06+00:00 UTC+00:00" |

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path before the run | The source path of the file before the run. `null` when a source file was created during the run. |
| Source path after the run | A recipe may modify the source path. This is the path after the run. `null` when a source file was deleted during the run. |
| Parent of the recipe that made changes | In a hierarchical recipe, the parent of the recipe that made a change. Empty if this is the root of a hierarchy or if the recipe is not hierarchical at all. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
