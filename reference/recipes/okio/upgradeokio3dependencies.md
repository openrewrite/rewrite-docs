## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-okhttp:0.4.0` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed): 
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.24.0")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.okio.UpgradeOkio3Dependencies")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-okhttp:0.4.0")
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gradle init script" %}
1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.
{% code title="init.gradle" %}
```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:6.24.0") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-okhttp:0.4.0")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.okio.UpgradeOkio3Dependencies")
        exportDatatables = true
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
