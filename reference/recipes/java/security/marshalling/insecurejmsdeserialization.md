# Insecure JMS deserialization

**org.openrewrite.java.security.marshalling.InsecureJmsDeserialization**

_JMS `Object` messages depend on Java Serialization for marshalling/unmarshalling of the message payload when `ObjectMessage#getObject` is called. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to security flaws._

## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-security:2.12.0` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed): 
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.security.marshalling.InsecureJmsDeserialization")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-security:2.12.0")
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gradle init script" %}
1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.
{% code title="init.gradle" %}
```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:6.23.3") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-security:2.12.0")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.security.marshalling.InsecureJmsDeserialization")
        exportDatatables = true
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run the recipe.
{% code title="shell" overflow="wrap"%}
```shell
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven POM" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>

        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.java.security.marshalling.InsecureJmsDeserialization</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-java-security</artifactId>
            <version>2.12.0</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
