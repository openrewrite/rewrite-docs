## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-java/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/ChangeType.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-java/8.36.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-java
* version: 8.36.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | oldFullyQualifiedTypeName | Fully-qualified class name of the original type. | `org.junit.Assume` |
| `String` | newFullyQualifiedTypeName | Fully-qualified class name of the replacement type, or the name of a primitive such as "int". The `OuterClassName$NestedClassName` naming convention should be used for nested classes. | `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions` |
| `Boolean` | ignoreDefinition | *Optional*. When set to `true` the definition of the old type will be left untouched. This is useful when you're replacing usage of a class but don't want to rename it. |  |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeTypeExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeTypeExample
displayName: Change type example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.ChangeType:
      oldFullyQualifiedTypeName: org.junit.Assume
      newFullyQualifiedTypeName: org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeTypeExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.24.0")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangeTypeExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.41.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ChangeTypeExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe ChangeTypeExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
