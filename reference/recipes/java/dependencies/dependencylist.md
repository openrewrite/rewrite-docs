* groupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
* artifactId: rewrite-java-dependencies
* version: 1.18.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `Scope` | scope | The scope of the dependencies to include in the report. Valid options: `Compile`, `Runtime`, `TestRuntime` | `Compile` |
| `boolean` | includeTransitive | Whether or not to include transitive dependencies in the report. Defaults to including only direct dependencies. | `true` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.DependencyListExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.DependencyListExample
displayName: Dependency report example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyList:
      scope: Compile
      includeTransitive: false
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.DependencyListExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.18.0 in your build file:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.DependencyListExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.18.0")
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.40.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.DependencyListExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-java-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>1.18.0</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe DependencyListExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

| ----------- | ----------- |
| Build tool | The build tool used to manage dependencies (Gradle or Maven). |
| Group id | The Group ID of the Gradle project or Maven module requesting the dependency. |
| Artifact id | The Artifact ID of the Gradle project or Maven module requesting the dependency. |
| Version | The version of Gradle project or Maven module requesting the dependency. |
| Dependency group id | The Group ID of the dependency. |
| Dependency artifact id | The Artifact ID of the dependency. |

| Source path before the run | The source path of the file before the run. `null` when a source file was created during the run. |
| Source path after the run | A recipe may modify the source path. This is the path after the run. `null` when a source file was deleted during the run. |
| Parent of the recipe that made changes | In a hierarchical recipe, the parent of the recipe that made a change. Empty if this is the root of a hierarchy or if the recipe is not hierarchical at all. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
