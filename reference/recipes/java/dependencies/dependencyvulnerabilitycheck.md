# Find and fix vulnerable dependencies

**org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

* groupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
* artifactId: rewrite-java-dependencies
* version: 1.11.1

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | scope | *Optional*. Match dependencies with the specified scope. Default is `compile`. Valid options: `compile`, `test`, `runtime`, `provided` | `compile` |
| `Boolean` | overrideTransitive | *Optional*. When enabled transitive dependencies with vulnerabilities will have their versions overridden. By default only direct dependencies have their version numbers upgraded. | `false` |
| `Boolean` | addMarkers | *Optional*. Report each vulnerability as search result markers. When enabled you can see which dependencies are bringing in vulnerable transitives in the diff view. By default these markers are omitted, making it easier to see version upgrades within the diff. |  |

## Data Tables

### Vulnerability report

_A vulnerability report that includes detailed information about the affected artifact and the corresponding CVEs._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CVE | The CVE number. |
| Group | The first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. |
| Artifact | The second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. |
| Version | The resolved version. |
| Fixed in version | The minimum version that is no longer vulnerable. |
| Fixable with version update only | Whether the vulnerability is likely to be fixed by increasing the dependency version only, with no code modifications required. This is a heuristic which assumes that the dependency is accurately versioned according to [semver](https://semver.org/). |
| Summary | The summary of the CVE. |
| Base score | The calculated base score. |
| Depth | Zero for direct dependencies. |
| CWEs | Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers; semicolon separated. |


## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.11.1` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed): 
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.16.1")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck")
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.11.1")
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gradle init script" %}
1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.
{% code title="init.gradle" %}
```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:6.16.1") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.11.1")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck")
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven POM" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.34.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-java-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>1.11.1</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
