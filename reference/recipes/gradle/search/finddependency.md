# Find Gradle dependency

**org.openrewrite.gradle.search.FindDependency**

_Finds dependencies declared in `build.gradle` files. See the [reference](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_configurations_graph) on Gradle configurations or the diagram below for a description of what configuration to use. A project's compile and runtime classpath is based on these configurations.

 A project's test classpath is based on these configurations.

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-gradle
* version: 8.35.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | groupId | The first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. | `com.google.guava` |
| `String` | artifactId | The second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. | `guava` |
| `String` | configuration | *Optional*. The dependency configuration to search for dependencies in. If omitted then all configurations will be searched. | `api` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindDependencyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.FindDependencyExample
displayName: Find Gradle dependency example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.search.FindDependency:
      groupId: com.google.guava
      artifactId: guava
      configuration: api
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.FindDependencyExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.FindDependencyExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe FindDependencyExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Data Tables

### Source files that had results
**org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileResults**

_Source files that were modified by the recipe run._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path before the run | The source path of the file before the run. `null` when a source file was created during the run. |
| Source path after the run | A recipe may modify the source path. This is the path after the run. `null` when a source file was deleted during the run. |
| Parent of the recipe that made changes | In a hierarchical recipe, the parent of the recipe that made a change. Empty if this is the root of a hierarchy or if the recipe is not hierarchical at all. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
**org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileErrors**

_The details of all errors produced by a recipe run._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path | The file that failed to parse. |
