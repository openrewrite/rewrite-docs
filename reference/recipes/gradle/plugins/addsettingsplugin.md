## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample
displayName: Add Gradle settings plugin example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.plugins.AddSettingsPlugin:
      pluginId: com.jfrog.bintray
      version: 3.x
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe AddSettingsPluginExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
