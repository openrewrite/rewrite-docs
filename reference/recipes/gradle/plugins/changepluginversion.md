[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-gradle/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/gradle/plugins/ChangePluginVersion.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-gradle/8.35.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-gradle
* version: 8.35.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | pluginIdPattern | The `ID` part of `plugin { ID }`, as a glob expression. | `com.jfrog.bintray` |
| `String` | newVersion | *Optional*. An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. You can also use `latest.release` for the latest available version and `latest.patch` if the current version is a valid semantic version. For more details, you can look at the documentation page of [version selectors](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/dependency-version-selectors). Defaults to `latest.release`. | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangePluginVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangePluginVersionExample
displayName: Change a Gradle plugin version by id example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.plugins.ChangePluginVersion:
      pluginIdPattern: com.jfrog.bintray
      newVersion: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangePluginVersionExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.23.3")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangePluginVersionExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe ChangePluginVersionExample
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
