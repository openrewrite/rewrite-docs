io.moderne.vulncheck.FixVulnCheckVulnerabilities,Use [VulnCheck Exploit Intelligence](https://docs.vulncheck.com/products/exploit-and-vulnerability-intelligence/exploit-intelligence) to fix vulnerabilities,This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence. The recipe has an option to limit fixes to only those vulnerabilities that have evidence of exploitation at various levels of severity.
org.openrewrite.FindCollidingSourceFiles,Find colliding source files,Finds source files which share a path with another source file. There should always be exactly one source file per path within a repository. This is a diagnostic for finding problems in OpenRewrite parsers/build plugins.
org.openrewrite.FindDeserializationErrors,Find deserialization errors,Produces a data table collecting all deserialization errors of serialized LSTs.
org.openrewrite.FindLstProvenance,Find LST provenance,Produces a data table showing what versions of OpenRewrite/Moderne tooling was used to produce a given LST.
org.openrewrite.FindParseFailures,Find source files with `ParseExceptionResult` markers,This recipe explores parse failures after an LST is produced for classifying the types of failures that can occur and prioritizing fixes according to the most common problems.
org.openrewrite.FindQuarks,Find instances of type `Quark`,`Quark` source files are pointers to the existence of a file without capturing any of the contents of the file.
org.openrewrite.FindSourceFiles,Find files,Find files by source path. Paths are always interpreted as relative to the repository root.
org.openrewrite.search.FindBuildMetadata,Find build metadata,Find source files with matching build metadata.
org.openrewrite.search.FindCommitters,Find committers on repositories,List the committers on a repository.
org.openrewrite.search.FindParseToPrintInequality,Find parse to print inequality,OpenRewrite `Parser` implementations should produce `SourceFile` objects whose `printAll()` method should be byte-for-byte equivalent with the original source file. When this isn't true recipes can still run on the `SourceFile` and even produce diffs but the diffs would fail to apply as a patch to the original source file. Most `Parser` use `Parser#requirePrintEqualsInput` to produce a `ParseError` when they fail to produce a `SourceFile` that is print idempotent.
org.openrewrite.search.RepositoryContainsFile,Repository contains file,Intended to be used primarily as a precondition for other recipes this recipe checks if a repository contains a specific file or files matching a pattern. If present all files in the repository are marked with a `SearchResult` marker. If you want to get only the matching file as a search result use `FindSourceFiles` instead.
org.openrewrite.text.Find,Find text,Textual search optionally using Regular Expression (regex) to query.
org.openrewrite.text.FindAndReplace,Find and replace,Textual find and replace optionally interpreting the search query as a Regular Expression (regex). When operating on source files that are language-specific Lossless Semantic Tree such as Java or XML this operation converts the source file to plain text for the rest of the recipe run. So if you are combining this recipe with language-specific recipes in a single recipe run put all the language-specific recipes before this recipe.
org.openrewrite.gradle.search.FindDependency,Find Gradle dependency,"Finds dependencies declared in gradle build files. See the [reference](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_configurations_graph) on Gradle configurations or the diagram below for a description of what configuration to use. A project's compile and runtime classpath is based on these configurations.  <img alt=""Gradle compile classpath"" src=""https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/img/java-library-ignore-deprecated-main.png"" width=""200px""/> A project's test classpath is based on these configurations.  <img alt=""Gradle test classpath"" src=""https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/img/java-library-ignore-deprecated-test.png"" width=""200px""/>."
