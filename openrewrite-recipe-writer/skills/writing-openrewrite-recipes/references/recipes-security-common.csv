io.moderne.vulncheck.FixVulnCheckVulnerabilities,Use [VulnCheck Exploit Intelligence](https://docs.vulncheck.com/products/exploit-and-vulnerability-intelligence/exploit-intelligence) to fix vulnerabilities,This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence. The recipe has an option to limit fixes to only those vulnerabilities that have evidence of exploitation at various levels of severity.
org.openrewrite.xml.security.AddOwaspDateBoundSuppressions,Add date bounds to OWASP suppressions,Adds an expiration date to all OWASP suppressions in order to ensure that they are periodically reviewed. For use with the OWASP `dependency-check` tool. More details: https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html.
org.openrewrite.xml.security.IsOwaspSuppressionsFile,Find OWASP vulnerability suppression XML files,These files are used to suppress false positives in OWASP [Dependency Check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck).
org.openrewrite.xml.security.RemoveOwaspSuppressions,Remove out-of-date OWASP suppressions,Remove all OWASP suppressions with a suppression end date in the past as these are no longer valid. For use with the OWASP `dependency-check` tool. More details on OWASP suppression files can be found [here](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html).
org.openrewrite.xml.security.UpdateOwaspSuppressionDate,Update OWASP suppression date bounds,Updates the expiration date for OWASP suppressions having a matching cve tag. For use with the OWASP `dependency-check` tool. More details: https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html.
org.openrewrite.github.security.InsecureCommandsRecipe,Find insecure commands configuration,Detects when insecure workflow commands are enabled via `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS`. This environment variable enables dangerous workflow commands that can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. Based on [zizmor's insecure-commands audit](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor/blob/main/crates/zizmor/src/audit/insecure_commands.rs).
org.openrewrite.github.security.TemplateInjectionRecipe,Find template injection vulnerabilities,Find GitHub Actions workflows vulnerable to template injection attacks. These occur when user-controllable input (like pull request titles issue bodies or commit messages) is used directly in `run` commands or `script` inputs without proper escaping. Attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary code. Based on [zizmor's `template-injection` audit](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor/blob/main/crates/zizmor/src/audit/template_injection.rs).
org.openrewrite.java.security.PartialPathTraversalVulnerability,Partial path traversal vulnerability,"Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath()` which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.  To demonstrate this vulnerability consider `""/usr/outnot"".startsWith(""/usr/out"")`. The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory. It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object. For example on Linux `println(new File(""/var""))` will print `/var` but `println(new File(""/var"" ""/"")` will print `/var/`; however `println(new File(""/var"" ""/"").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`."
org.openrewrite.java.security.marshalling.InsecureJmsDeserialization,Insecure JMS deserialization,JMS `Object` messages depend on Java Serialization for marshalling/unmarshalling of the message payload when `ObjectMessage#getObject` is called. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
org.openrewrite.java.security.servlet.CookieSetSecure,Insecure cookies,Check for use of insecure cookies. Cookies should be marked as secure. This ensures that the cookie is sent only over HTTPS to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
org.openrewrite.java.security.XmlParserXXEVulnerability,XML parser XXE vulnerability,Avoid exposing dangerous features of the XML parser by updating certain factory settings.
org.openrewrite.java.security.spring.CsrfProtection,Enable CSRF attack prevention,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site email blog instant message or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated. See the full [OWASP cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
