Existing code which relies on this behavior will be modified by addition of explicit cascade=PERSIST to the association fields._
* [Migrate to @TargetEmbeddable](/recipes/hibernate/update70/migratetotargetembeddable.md) - _Migrates code using removed @Target to to Hibernate 7.0's @TargetEmbeddable equivalent. Removes misused @Target annotations._

These control characters can alter how source code is presented to a human reader without affecting its interpretation by tools like compilers. So a malicious patch could pass code review while introducing vulnerabilities. Note that text direction-changing unicode control characters aren't inherently malicious. These characters can appear for legitimate reasons in code written in or dealing with right-to-left languages. See: https://trojansource.codes/ for more information._
* [Find vulnerable uses of Jackson `@JsonTypeInfo`](/recipes/java/security/search/findvulnerablejacksonjsontypeinfo.md) - _Identify where attackers can deserialize gadgets into a target field._

* [Java security best practices](/recipes/java/security/javasecuritybestpractices.md) - _Applies security best practices to Java code._
* [Partial path traversal vulnerability](/recipes/java/security/partialpathtraversalvulnerability.md) - _Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath()`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.  To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `&quot;/usr/outnot&quot;.startsWith(&quot;/usr/out&quot;)`. The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory. It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object. For example, on Linux, `println(new File(&quot;/var&quot;))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(&quot;/var&quot;, &quot;/&quot;)` will print `/var/`; however, `println(new File(&quot;/var&quot;, &quot;/&quot;).getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`._
* [Prevent clickjacking](/recipes/java/security/spring/preventclickjacking.md) - _The `frame-ancestors` directive can be used in a Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `&lt;frame&gt;` or `&lt;iframe&gt;`. Sites can use this to avoid Clickjacking attacks by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites._
* [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS)](/recipes/java/security/regularexpressiondenialofservice.md) - _ReDoS is a Denial of Service attack that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size).

* [Remove hard-coded IP addresses from comments](/recipes/text/removehardcodedipaddressesfromcomments.md) - _Removes hard-coded IPv4 addresses from comments when they match private IP ranges or loopback addresses. This targets IP addresses that are commented out in various comment formats:  **Private IP ranges:**  * `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`  * `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`  * `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`  **Loopback IP range:**  * `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`  **Supported comment formats:**  * C-style line comments (`//`)  * C-style block comments (`/* */`)  * Shell/Python style comments (`#`)  * XML comments (`&lt;!-- --&gt;`)  * YAML comments (`#`)  * Properties file comments (`#` or `!`)  For line comments, the entire line is removed.

* [Remove unused dependencies](/recipes/java/dependencies/removeunuseddependencies.md) - _Scans through source code collecting references to types and methods, removing any dependencies that are not used from Maven or Gradle build files. This recipe takes reflective access into account: When reflective access to a class is made unambiguously via a string literal, such as: `Class.forName(&quot;java.util.List&quot;)` that is counted correctly. When reflective access to a class is made ambiguously via anything other than a string literal no dependencies will be removed. This recipe takes transitive dependencies into account: When a direct dependency is not used but a transitive dependency it brings in _is_ in use the direct dependency is not removed._
* [Secure Spring service exporters](/recipes/java/security/spring/insecurespringserviceexporter.md) - _The default Java deserialization mechanism is available via `ObjectInputStream` class. This mechanism is known to be vulnerable. If an attacker can make an application deserialize malicious data, it may result in arbitrary code execution.  Spring’s `RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter` uses the default Java deserialization mechanism to parse data. As a result, all classes that extend it are vulnerable to deserialization attacks. The Spring Framework contains at least `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` and `SimpleHttpInvokerServiceExporter` that extend `RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter`. These exporters parse data from the HTTP body using the unsafe Java deserialization mechanism.  See the full [blog post](https://blog.gypsyengineer.com/en/security/detecting-dangerous-spring-exporters-with-codeql.html) by Artem Smotrakov on CVE-2016-1000027 from which the above description is excerpted._

* [Migrate `exactly_once` and `exactly_once_beta` to `exactly_once_v2`](/recipes/kafka/streams/processingguaranteeexactlyoncetov2.md) - _Kafka Streams 2.6 introduces the exactly-once semantics v2, which is a more efficient implementation with improved internal handling. Starting from 3.0, it becomes the default &quot;exactly_once_v2&quot;._
* [Migrate `exactly_once` to `exactly_once_beta`](/recipes/kafka/streams/processingguaranteeexactlyoncetobeta.md) - _Kafka Streams 2.6 introduces the exactly-once semantics v2, which is a more efficient implementation with improved internal handling. Though it is beta, it’s fully backward-compatible from the API standpoint, but internally it uses a different transaction/commit protocol. Starting from 3.0, it becomes the default &quot;exactly_once_v2&quot;._
* [Migrate deprecated `KafkaStreams#store` method](/recipes/kafka/streams/migratekafkastreamsstoremethod.md) - _In Kafka Streams 2.5, the method `KafkaStreams#store(String storeName, QueryableStoreType&lt;T&gt; storeType)` was deprecated. It only allowed querying active stores and did not support any additional query options. Use the new `StoreQueryParameters` API instead._
* [Migrate deprecated retry configuration to task timeout](/recipes/kafka/streams/migrateretryconfiguration.md) - _In Kafka 2.7, `RETRIES_CONFIG` and `RETRY_BACKOFF_MS_CONFIG` were deprecated in favor of `TASK_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG`. This recipe migrates the old retry configuration to the new task timeout configuration, attempting to preserve the retry budget by multiplying retries × backoff time. If only one config is present, it falls back to 60000ms (1 minute)._

* [Migrate to StreamsUncaughtExceptionHandler API](/recipes/kafka/streams/migratestreamsuncaughtexceptionhandler.md) - _Migrates from the JVM-level Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler to Kafka Streams' StreamsUncaughtExceptionHandler API introduced in version 2.8. This new API provides explicit control over how the Streams client should respond to uncaught exceptions (REPLACE_THREAD, SHUTDOWN_CLIENT, or SHUTDOWN_APPLICATION)._
* [Remove `PartitionGrouper` configuration](/recipes/kafka/streams/removepartitiongrouperconfiguration.md) - _Starting with Kafka Streams 2.4, the `PartitionGrouper` API was deprecated and partition grouping is now fully handled internally by the library.

* [Use VulnCheck Exploit Intelligence to fix vulnerabilities](/recipes/vulncheck/fixvulncheckvulnerabilities.md) - _This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence. The recipe has an option to limit fixes to only those vulnerabilities that have evidence of exploitation at various levels of severity._
