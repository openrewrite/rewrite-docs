### [Prevent clickjacking](../recipes/java/security/spring/preventclickjacking.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.security.spring.PreventClickjacking_

The `frame-ancestors` directive can be used in a Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>`. Sites can use this to avoid Clickjacking attacks by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

### [Create `index.jelly` if it doesn't exist](../recipes/jenkins/createindexjelly.md)
_org.openrewrite.jenkins.CreateIndexJelly_

Jenkins tooling [requires](https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-hpi-plugin/pull/302) `src/main/resources/index.jelly` exists with a description.

### [Upgrade jenkins java version](../recipes/jenkins/upgradejavaversion.md)

### [Add `snakeyaml` dependency if needed](../recipes/java/micronaut/addsnakeyamldependencyifneeded.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.AddSnakeYamlDependencyIfNeeded_

This recipe will add the `snakeyaml` dependency to a Micronaut 4 application that uses yaml configuration.

### [Copy non-inherited annotations from super class](../recipes/java/micronaut/copynoninheritedannotations.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.CopyNonInheritedAnnotations_

As of Micronaut 3.x only [annotations](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/3.0.x/src/main/docs/guide/appendix/breaks.adoc#annotation-inheritance) that are explicitly meta-annotated with `@Inherited` are inherited from parent classes and interfaces.

### [Add `@Introspected` to classes requiring a map representation](../recipes/java/micronaut/typerequiresintrospection.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.TypeRequiresIntrospection_

In Micronaut 2.x a reflection-based strategy was used to retrieve that information if the class was not annotated with `@Introspected`. As of Micronaut 3.x it is required to annotate classes with `@Introspected` that are used in this way.

### [Adds `static` modifier to `@Produces` fields that are in session beans](../recipes/java/migrate/addstaticvariableonproducersessionbean.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.AddStaticVariableOnProducerSessionBean_

Ensures that the fields annotated with `@Produces` which is inside the session bean (`@Stateless`, `@Stateful`, or `@Singleton`) are declared `static`.

### [Project has no Jakarta annotations](../recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/hasnojakartaannotations.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.HasNoJakartaAnnotations_

Mark all source as found per `JavaProject` where no Jakarta annotations are found. This is useful mostly as a precondition for recipes that require Jakarta annotations to be present

### [Use latest JAXB API and runtime for Jakarta EE 8](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addjaxbruntime.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddJaxbRuntime_

Update build files to use the latest JAXB runtime from Jakarta EE 8 to maintain compatibility with Java version 11 or greater. The recipe will add a JAXB run-time, in Gradle `compileOnly`+`testImplementation` and Maven `provided` scope, to any project that has a transitive dependency on the JAXB API. **The resulting dependencies still use the `javax` namespace, despite the move to the Jakarta artifact**.

### [Add scope annotation to injected classes](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addscopetoinjectedclass.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddScopeToInjectedClass_

Finds member variables annotated with `@Inject' and applies `@Dependent` scope annotation to the variable's type.

### [Unannotated entity attributes require a Transient annotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtoentity.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToEntity_

In OpenJPA, attributes that are themselves entity classes are not persisted by default. EclipseLink has a different default behavior and tries to persist these attributes to the database. To keep the OpenJPA behavior of ignoring unannotated entity attributes, add the `javax.persistence.Transient` annotation to these attributes in EclipseLink.

### [`@Embeddable` classes cannot have an `@Id` annotation when referenced by an `@EmbeddedId` annotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/removeembeddableid.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveEmbeddableId_

According to the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, if an entity defines an attribute with an `@EmbeddedId` annotation, the embeddable class cannot contain an attribute with an `@Id` annotation. If both the `@EmbeddedId` annotation and the `@Id` annotation are defined, OpenJPA ignores the `@Id` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception.

### [Migrate Joda-Time to Java time](../recipes/java/migrate/joda/jodatimerecipe.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.joda.JodaTimeRecipe_

Prefer the Java standard library over third-party usage of Joda Time.

### [Rename getter methods to fit Lombok](../recipes/java/migrate/lombok/adoptlombokgettermethodnames.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.AdoptLombokGetterMethodNames_

Rename methods that are effectively getter to the name Lombok would give them.

Limitations:
 - If two methods in a class are effectively the same getter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.
 - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.
 - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other.
E.g. `int getFoo() { return ba; } int getBa() { return foo; }` stays as it is.

### [Convert `@lombok.Value` class to Record](../recipes/java/migrate/lombok/lombokvaluetorecord.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.LombokValueToRecord_

Convert Lombok `@Value` annotated classes to standard Java Records.

### [Plan a Java version migration](../recipes/java/migrate/search/planjavamigration.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.search.PlanJavaMigration_

Study the set of Java versions and associated tools in use across many repositories.

### [Find and fix vulnerable npm dependencies](../recipes/nodejs/dependencyvulnerabilitycheck.md)
_org.openrewrite.nodejs.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck_

This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable.

### [Node.js dependency insight](../recipes/nodejs/search/dependencyinsight.md)
_org.openrewrite.nodejs.search.DependencyInsight_

Identify the direct and transitive Node.js dependencies used in a project.

### [Find Node.js projects](../recipes/nodejs/search/findnodeprojects.md)
_org.openrewrite.nodejs.search.FindNodeProjects_

Find Node.js projects and summarize data about them.

### [Extract documentation examples from tests](../recipes/java/recipes/examplesextractor.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.recipes.ExamplesExtractor_

Extract the before/after sources from tests annotated with `@DocumentExample`, and generate a YAML file with those examples to be shown in the documentation to show usage.

### [Rename bean](../recipes/java/spring/renamebean.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.RenameBean_

Renames a Spring bean, both declaration and references.

### [Separate application YAML by profile](../recipes/java/spring/separateapplicationyamlbyprofile.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.SeparateApplicationYamlByProfile_

The Spring team's recommendation is to separate profile properties into their own YAML files now.

### [Update the API manifest](../recipes/java/spring/updateapimanifest.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.UpdateApiManifest_

Keep a consolidated manifest of the API endpoints that this application exposes up-to-date.

### [Merge Spring `bootstrap.yml` with `application.yml`](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/mergebootstrapyamlwithapplicationyaml.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.MergeBootstrapYamlWithApplicationYaml_

In Spring Boot 2.4, support for `bootstrap.yml` was removed. It's properties should be merged with `application.yml`.

### [Use `AutoConfiguration#imports`](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/moveautoconfigurationtoimportsfile.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.MoveAutoConfigurationToImportsFile_

Use `AutoConfiguration#imports` instead of the deprecated entry `EnableAutoConfiguration` in `spring.factories` when defining autoconfiguration classes.

### [Integration scheduler pool size](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/integrationschedulerpoolrecipe.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.IntegrationSchedulerPoolRecipe_

Spring Integration now reuses an available `TaskScheduler` rather than configuring its own. In a typical application setup relying on the auto-configuration, this means that Spring Integration uses the auto-configured task scheduler that has a pool size of 1. To restore Spring Integrationâs default of 10 threads, use the `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size` property.

### [Applications using logging shutdown hooks](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/loggingshutdownhooks.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.LoggingShutdownHooks_

Spring Boot registers a logging shutdown hook by default for JAR-based applications to ensure that logging resources are released when the JVM exits. If your application is deployed as a WAR then the shutdown hook is not registered since the servlet container usually handles logging concerns. 

Most applications will want the shutdown hook. However, if your application has complex context hierarchies, then you may need to disable it. You can use the `logging.register-shutdown-hook` property to do that.

### [Maintain trailing slash URL mappings](../recipes/java/spring/boot3/maintaintrailingslashurlmappings.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.MaintainTrailingSlashURLMappings_

This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping("/some/greeting")` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is to maintain trailing slash in all HTTP url mappings.

### [Add logging.pattern.level for traceId and spanId](../recipes/java/spring/cloud2022/addloggingpatternlevelforsleuth.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.cloud2022.AddLoggingPatternLevelForSleuth_

Add `logging.pattern.level` for traceId and spanId which was previously set by default, if not already set.

### [Migrate `Docket` to `GroupedOpenAPI`](../recipes/java/spring/doc/migratedocketbeantogroupedopenapibean.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.doc.MigrateDocketBeanToGroupedOpenApiBean_

Migrate a `Docket` bean to a `GroupedOpenAPI` bean preserving group name, packages and paths. When possible the recipe will prefer property based configuration.

### [Replace String literals with `HttpHeaders` constants](../recipes/java/spring/http/replacestringliteralswithhttpheadersconstants.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.http.ReplaceStringLiteralsWithHttpHeadersConstants_

Replace String literals with `org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders` constants.

### [Replace String literals with `MediaType` constants](../recipes/java/spring/http/replacestringliteralswithmediatypeconstants.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.http.ReplaceStringLiteralsWithMediaTypeConstants_

Replace String literals with `org.springframework.http.MediaType` constants.

### [Upgrade Spring dependencies](../recipes/maven/spring/upgradeexplicitspringbootdependencies.md)
_org.openrewrite.maven.spring.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependencies_

Upgrades dependencies according to the specified version of spring boot. Spring boot has many direct and transitive dependencies. When a module has an explicit dependency on one of these it may also need to be upgraded to match the version used by spring boot.

### [Rename packages to lowercase](../recipes/staticanalysis/lowercasepackage.md)
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.LowercasePackage_

By convention all Java package names should contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. This recipe converts any uppercase letters in package names to be lowercase.

### [Standardize method name casing](../recipes/staticanalysis/methodnamecasing.md)
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.MethodNameCasing_

Fixes method names that do not follow standard naming conventions. For example, `String getFoo_bar()` would be adjusted to `String getFooBar()` and `int DoSomething()` would be adjusted to `int doSomething()`.

### [Remove `public` visibility of JUnit 5 tests](../recipes/java/testing/cleanup/testsshouldnotbepublic.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.cleanup.TestsShouldNotBePublic_

Remove `public` and optionally `protected` modifiers from methods with `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@TestFactory`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll`. They no longer have to be public visibility to be usable by JUnit 5.

### [Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency](../recipes/java/testing/junit5/addhamcrestjunitdependency.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddHamcrestJUnitDependency_

Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency only if JUnit 4's `assertThat` or `assumeThat` is used.

### [Add JUnit Jupiter dependencies](../recipes/java/testing/junit5/addjupiterdependencies.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddJupiterDependencies_

Adds JUnit Jupiter dependencies to a Maven or Gradle project. Junit Jupiter can be added either with the artifact junit-jupiter, or both of junit-jupiter-api and junit-jupiter-engine. This adds "junit-jupiter" dependency unless "junit-jupiter-api" or "junit-jupiter-engine" are already present.

### [Replace Mockito 1.x `anyString()`/`any()` with `nullable(Class)`](../recipes/java/testing/mockito/anytonullable.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.mockito.AnyToNullable_

Since Mockito 2.10 `anyString()` and `any()` no longer matches null values. Use `nullable(Class)` instead.

### [Replace `verifyZeroInteractions()` to `verifyNoMoreInteractions()](../recipes/java/testing/mockito/verifyzerotonomoreinteractions.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.mockito.VerifyZeroToNoMoreInteractions_

Replaces `verifyZeroInteractions()` with `verifyNoMoreInteractions()` in Mockito tests when migration when using a Mockito version < 3.x.

### [Find unit tests](../recipes/java/testing/search/findunittests.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.search.FindUnitTests_

Produces a data table showing how methods are used in unit tests.
