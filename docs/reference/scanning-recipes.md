# Scanning Recipes

_This doc contains all [scanning recipes](/concepts-and-explanations/recipes#scanning-recipes)._

## rewrite-ai-search

* [Find method invocations that resemble a pattern](/recipes/ai/research/findcodethatresembles.md) - _This recipe uses two phase AI approach to find a method invocation that resembles a search string._

* [Language composition report](/recipes/core/languagecomposition.md) - _Counts the number of lines of the various kinds of source code and data formats parsed by OpenRewrite. Comments are not included in line counts. This recipe emits its results as two data tables, making no changes to any source file. One data table is per-file, the other is per-repository._
## rewrite-analysis

* [React i18next internationalization](/recipes/codemods/reacti18next.md) - _Automatically internationalizes React applications by extracting hardcoded strings and replacing them with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com) translation calls. Handles JSX text, attributes, and template literals with variables. Creates and updates a translation JSON file with extracted strings._
* [Run Putout](/recipes/codemods/putout.md) - _Run [Putout](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout) on your projects._

Please note that this recipes requires existing plain text files' format to be successfully parsable by OpenRewrite. If a file is left unchanged, it might be parsed as a `Quark` rather than plain text. In such case, use the `plainTextMask` option. See the [Gradle](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/gradle-plugin-configuration#configuring-the-rewrite-dsl) or [Maven](https://openrewrite.github.io/rewrite-maven-plugin/run-mojo.html#plainTextMasks) plugin configuration page._

* [Repository contains file](/recipes/search/repositorycontainsfile.md) - _Intended to be used primarily as a precondition for other recipes, this recipe checks if a repository contains a specific file or files matching a pattern. If present all files in the repository are marked with a `SearchResult` marker. If you want to get only the matching file as a search result, use `FindSourceFiles` instead._
* [Show Git source control metadata](/recipes/core/findgitprovenance.md) - _List out the contents of each unique `GitProvenance` marker in the set of source files. When everything is working correctly, exactly one such marker should be printed as all source files are expected to come from the same repository / branch / commit hash._

The intent is clearer and it is more performant than using 'Enumerable.Any()' extension method._
* [Avoid using redundant else](/recipes/csharp/recipes/meziantou/analyzer/avoidusingredundantelsema0071.md) - _The 'if' block contains a jump statement (break, continue, goto, return, throw, yield break). Using 'else' is redundant and needlessly maintains a higher nesting level._

* [Module has dependency](/recipes/gradle/search/modulehasdependency.md) - _Searches for Gradle Projects (modules) that have a dependency matching the specified id or implementing class. Places a `SearchResult` marker on all sources within a project with a matching dependency. This recipe is intended to be used as a precondition for other recipes. For example this could be used to limit the application of a spring boot migration to only projects that use spring-boot-starter, limiting unnecessary upgrading. If the search result you want is instead just the build.gradle(.kts) file that use the dependency, use the `FindDependency` recipe instead._

Or For a maven project, Add a Maven dependency to a `pom.xml` file in the correct scope based on where it is used._
* [Dependency resolution diagnostic](/recipes/java/dependencies/dependencyresolutiondiagnostic.md) - _Recipes which manipulate dependencies must be able to successfully access the artifact repositories and resolve dependencies from them. This recipe produces two data tables used to understand the state of dependency resolution.   The Repository accessibility report lists all the artifact repositories known to the project and whether respond to network access. The network access is attempted while the recipe is run and so is representative of current conditions.   The Gradle dependency configuration errors lists all the dependency configurations that failed to resolve one or more dependencies when the project was parsed. This is representative of conditions at the time the LST was parsed._
* [Find minimum JUnit version](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumjunitversion.md) - _A recipe to find the minimum version of JUnit dependencies. This recipe is designed to return the minimum version of JUnit in a project. It will search for JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 dependencies in the project. If both versions are found, it will return the minimum version of JUnit 4. If a minimumVersion is provided, the recipe will search to see if the minimum version of JUnit used by the project is no lower than the minimumVersion. For example: if the minimumVersion is 4, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 4.12. If the project has only JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 5.7. Another example: if the minimumVersion is 5, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will not return any results._
* [Find relocated dependencies](/recipes/java/dependencies/relocateddependencycheck.md) - _Find Maven and Gradle dependencies and Maven plugins that have relocated to a new `groupId` or `artifactId`. Relocation information comes from the [oga-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/oga-maven-plugin/) maintained by Jonathan Lermitage, Filipe Roque and others.

* [Remove unused dependencies](/recipes/java/dependencies/removeunuseddependencies.md) - _Scans through source code collecting references to types and methods, removing any dependencies that are not used from Maven or Gradle build files. This recipe takes reflective access into account: When reflective access to a class is made unambiguously via a string literal, such as: `Class.forName(&quot;java.util.List&quot;)` that is counted correctly. When reflective access to a class is made ambiguously via anything other than a string literal no dependencies will be removed. This recipe takes transitive dependencies into account: When a direct dependency is not used but a transitive dependency it brings in _is_ in use the direct dependency is not removed._
* [Software bill of materials](/recipes/java/dependencies/softwarebillofmaterials.md) - _Produces a software bill of materials (SBOM) for a project.

* [Rename getter methods to fit Lombok](/recipes/java/migrate/lombok/adoptlombokgettermethodnames.md) - _Rename methods that are effectively getter to the name Lombok would give them.  Limitations:  - If two methods in a class are effectively the same getter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.  - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.  - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other. E.g. `int getFoo() { return ba; } int getBa() { return foo; }` stays as it is._
* [Rename setter methods to fit Lombok](/recipes/java/migrate/lombok/adoptlomboksettermethodnames.md) - _Rename methods that are effectively setter to the name Lombok would give them.

* [Applications using logging shutdown hooks](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/loggingshutdownhooks.md) - _Spring Boot registers a logging shutdown hook by default for JAR-based applications to ensure that logging resources are released when the JVM exits. If your application is deployed as a WAR then the shutdown hook is not registered since the servlet container usually handles logging concerns.   Most applications will want the shutdown hook. However, if your application has complex context hierarchies, then you may need to disable it. You can use the `logging.register-shutdown-hook` property to do that._
* [Integration scheduler pool size](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/integrationschedulerpoolrecipe.md) - _Spring Integration now reuses an available `TaskScheduler` rather than configuring its own. In a typical application setup relying on the auto-configuration, this means that Spring Integration uses the auto-configured task scheduler that has a pool size of 1.

This allows for programmatic configuration of the web application context, replacing the need for XML-based configuration. This recipe only picks up `web.xml` files located in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory to avoid inference with tests. It creates a `WebXmlWebAppInitializer` class in `src/main/java` with respect to submodules if they contain java files. **If it finds an existing `WebXmlWebAppInitializer`, it skips the creation**._
* [Rename bean](/recipes/java/spring/renamebean.md) - _Renames a Spring bean, both declaration and references._
* [Separate `application.properties` by profile](/recipes/java/spring/separateapplicationpropertiesbyprofile.md) - _Separating `application.properties` into separate files based on profiles._
* [Separate application YAML by profile](/recipes/java/spring/separateapplicationyamlbyprofile.md) - _The Spring team's recommendation is to separate profile properties into their own YAML files now._
* [Update the API manifest](/recipes/java/spring/updateapimanifest.md) - _Keep a consolidated manifest of the API endpoints that this application exposes up-to-date._
* [Upgrade Spring dependencies](/recipes/maven/spring/upgradeexplicitspringbootdependencies.md) - _Upgrades dependencies according to the specified version of spring boot. Spring boot has many direct and transitive dependencies. When a module has an explicit dependency on one of these it may also need to be upgraded to match the version used by spring boot._
* [Use `AutoConfiguration#imports`](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/moveautoconfigurationtoimportsfile.md) - _Use `AutoConfiguration#imports` instead of the deprecated entry `EnableAutoConfiguration` in `spring.factories` when defining autoconfiguration classes._
* [Use `spring.reactor.context-propagation` property](/recipes/java/spring/boot3/migratehookstoreactorcontextproperty.md) - _Replace `Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation()` with `spring.reactor.context-propagation=true`._
## rewrite-static-analysis

* [Rename packages to lowercase](/recipes/staticanalysis/lowercasepackage.md) - _By convention all Java package names should contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. This recipe converts any uppercase letters in package names to be lowercase._
* [Standardize method name casing](/recipes/staticanalysis/methodnamecasing.md) - _Fixes method names that do not follow standard naming conventions. For example, `String getFoo_bar()` would be adjusted to `String getFooBar()` and `int DoSomething()` would be adjusted to `int doSomething()`._
## rewrite-testing-frameworks

* [Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency](/recipes/java/testing/junit5/addhamcrestjunitdependency.md) - _Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency only if JUnit 4's `assertThat` or `assumeThat` is used._
* [Add JUnit Jupiter dependencies](/recipes/java/testing/junit5/addjupiterdependencies.md) - _Adds JUnit Jupiter dependencies to a Maven or Gradle project. JUnit Jupiter can be added either with the artifact `junit-jupiter`, or both of `junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-engine`. This adds `junit-jupiter` dependency unless `junit-jupiter-api` or `junit-jupiter-engine` are already present._
* [Find unit tests](/recipes/java/testing/search/findunittests.md) - _Produces a data table showing how methods are used in unit tests._
* [Remove `public` visibility of JUnit 5 tests](/recipes/java/testing/cleanup/testsshouldnotbepublic.md) - _Remove `public` and optionally `protected` modifiers from methods with `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@TestFactory`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll`. They no longer have to be public visibility to be usable by JUnit 5._
* [Replace Mockito 1.x `anyString()`/`any()` with `nullable(Class)`](/recipes/java/testing/mockito/anytonullable.md) - _Since Mockito 2.10 `anyString()` and `any()` no longer matches null values. Use `nullable(Class)` instead._
* [Replace `verifyZeroInteractions()` with `verifyNoMoreInteractions()`](/recipes/java/testing/mockito/verifyzerotonomoreinteractions.md) - _Replaces `verifyZeroInteractions()` with `verifyNoMoreInteractions()` in Mockito tests when migration when using a Mockito version &lt; 3.x._
## rewrite-toml

* [Create TOML file](/recipes/toml/createtomlfile.md) - _Create a new TOML file._
## rewrite-vulncheck

* [Use VulnCheck Exploit Intelligence to fix vulnerabilities](/recipes/vulncheck/fixvulncheckvulnerabilities.md) - _This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence. The recipe has an option to limit fixes to only those vulnerabilities that have evidence of exploitation at various levels of severity._
## rewrite-xml

* [Create XML file](/recipes/xml/createxmlfile.md) - _Create a new XML file._
* [XML style Auto-detection debug](/recipes/xml/style/autodetectdebug.md) - _Runs XML Autodetect and records the results in data tables and search markers. A debugging tool for figuring out why XML documents get styled the way they do._
## rewrite-yaml

* [Copy YAML value](/recipes/yaml/copyvalue.md) - _Copies a YAML value from one key to another. The existing key/value pair remains unaffected by this change. Attempts to merge the copied value into the new key if it already exists. Attempts to create the new key if it does not exist._
* [Create YAML file](/recipes/yaml/createyamlfile.md) - _Create a new YAML file._
