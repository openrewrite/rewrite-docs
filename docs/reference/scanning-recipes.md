_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyResolutionDiagnostic_

Recipes which manipulate dependencies must be able to successfully access the artifact repositories and resolve dependencies from them. This recipe produces two data tables used to understand the state of dependency resolution. 

The Repository accessibility report lists all the artifact repositories known to the project and whether respond to network access. The network access is attempted while the recipe is run and so is representative of current conditions. 

The Gradle dependency configuration errors lists all the dependency configurations that failed to resolve one or more dependencies when the project was parsed. This is representative of conditions at the time the LST was parsed.

### [Find relocated dependencies](../recipes/java/dependencies/relocateddependencycheck.md)

### [Upgrade Gradle or Maven dependency versions](../recipes/java/dependencies/upgradedependencyversion.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeDependencyVersion_

For Gradle projects, upgrade the version of a dependency in a `build.gradle` file. Supports updating dependency declarations of various forms:
 * `String` notation: `"group:artifact:version"` 
 * `Map` notation: `group: 'group', name: 'artifact', version: 'version'`
It is possible to update version numbers which are defined earlier in the same file in variable declarations.

For Maven projects, upgrade the version of a dependency by specifying a group ID and (optionally) an artifact ID using Node Semver advanced range selectors, allowing more precise control over version updates to patch or minor releases.

### [Upgrade transitive Gradle or Maven dependencies](../recipes/java/dependencies/upgradetransitivedependencyversion.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion_

### [Find the oldest matching dependency version in use](../recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumdependencyversion.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindMinimumDependencyVersion_

The oldest dependency version in use is the lowest dependency version in use in any source set of any subproject of a repository. It is possible that, for example, the main source set of a project uses Jackson 2.11, but a test source set uses Jackson 2.16. In this case, the oldest Jackson version in use is Java 2.11.

### [Find minimum JUnit version](../recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumjunitversion.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindMinimumJUnitVersion_

A recipe to find the minimum version of JUnit dependencies. This recipe is designed to return the minimum version of JUnit in a project. It will search for JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 dependencies in the project. If both versions are found, it will return the minimum version of JUnit 4.
If a minimumVersion is provided, the recipe will search to see if the minimum version of JUnit used by the project is no lower than the minimumVersion.
For example: if the minimumVersion is 4, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 4.12. If the project has only JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 5.7.
Another example: if the minimumVersion is 5, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will not return any results.

If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Upgrades dependencies versioned according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Last updated: 2025-05-05T1102.

### [No host network sharing](../recipes/kubernetes/nohostnetworksharing.md)
_org.openrewrite.kubernetes.NoHostNetworkSharing_

When using the host network mode for a container, that container’s network stack is not isolated from the Docker host, so the container shares the host’s networking namespace and does not get its own IP-address allocation.

### [Read-only root filesystem](../recipes/kubernetes/readonlyrootfilesystem.md)
_org.openrewrite.kubernetes.ReadOnlyRootFilesystem_

Using an immutable root filesystem and a verified boot mechanism prevents against attackers from "owning" the machine through permanent local changes.

### [Unannotated entity attributes require a Transient annotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtoentity.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToEntity_

In OpenJPA, attributes that are themselves entity classes are not persisted by default. EclipseLink has a different default behavior and tries to persist these attributes to the database. To keep the OpenJPA behavior of ignoring unannotated entity attributes, add the `javax.persistence.Transient` annotation to these attributes in EclipseLink.

### [`@Embeddable` classes cannot have an `@Id` annotation when referenced by an `@EmbeddedId` annotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/removeembeddableid.md)

According to the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, if an entity defines an attribute with an `@EmbeddedId` annotation, the embeddable class cannot contain an attribute with an `@Id` annotation. If both the `@EmbeddedId` annotation and the `@Id` annotation are defined, OpenJPA ignores the `@Id` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception.

### [Migrate Joda-Time to Java time](../recipes/java/migrate/joda/jodatimerecipe.md)

_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.AdoptLombokGetterMethodNames_

Rename methods that are effectively getter to the name Lombok would give them.

Limitations:
 - If two methods in a class are effectively the same getter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.
 - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.
 - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other.
E.g. `int getFoo() { return ba; } int getBa() { return foo; }` stays as it is.

### [Convert `@lombok.Value` class to Record](../recipes/java/migrate/lombok/lombokvaluetorecord.md)

Spring Integration now reuses an available `TaskScheduler` rather than configuring its own. In a typical application setup relying on the auto-configuration, this means that Spring Integration uses the auto-configured task scheduler that has a pool size of 1. To restore Spring Integration’s default of 10 threads, use the `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size` property.

### [Applications using logging shutdown hooks](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/loggingshutdownhooks.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.LoggingShutdownHooks_

Spring Boot registers a logging shutdown hook by default for JAR-based applications to ensure that logging resources are released when the JVM exits. If your application is deployed as a WAR then the shutdown hook is not registered since the servlet container usually handles logging concerns. 

Most applications will want the shutdown hook. However, if your application has complex context hierarchies, then you may need to disable it. You can use the `logging.register-shutdown-hook` property to do that.

This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping("/some/greeting")` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is to maintain trailing slash in all HTTP url mappings.
