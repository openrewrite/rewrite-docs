# Scanning Recipes

_This doc contains all [scanning recipes](/concepts-and-explanations/recipes#scanning-recipes)._


## org.openrewrite.meta:rewrite-analysis

* [org.openrewrite.analysis.search.FindFlowBetweenMethods](/recipes/analysis/search/findflowbetweenmethods.md)
  * **Finds flow between two methods**
  * Takes two patterns for the start/end methods to find flow between.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-all

* [org.openrewrite.FindDuplicateSourceFiles](/recipes/core/findduplicatesourcefiles.md)
  * **Find duplicate source files**
  * Record the presence of LSTs with duplicate paths, indicating that the same file was parsed more than once.
* [org.openrewrite.LanguageComposition](/recipes/core/languagecomposition.md)
  * **Language composition report**
  * Counts the number of lines of the various kinds of source code and data formats parsed by OpenRewrite. Comments are not included in line counts. This recipe emits its results as two data tables, making no changes to any source file. One data table is per-file, the other is per-repository.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-codemods

* [org.openrewrite.codemods.ApplyCodemod](/recipes/codemods/applycodemod.md)
  * **Applies a codemod to all source files**
  * Applies a codemod represented by an NPM package to all source files.
* [org.openrewrite.codemods.Biome](/recipes/codemods/biome.md)
  * **Biome recommendations**
  * Run [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) recommended settings on your projects.
* [org.openrewrite.codemods.ESLint](/recipes/codemods/eslint.md)
  * **Lint source code with ESLint**
  * Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) across the code to fix common static analysis issues in the code.  This requires the code to have an existing ESLint configuration.
* [org.openrewrite.codemods.Putout](/recipes/codemods/putout.md)
  * **Run Putout**
  * Run [Putout](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout) on your projects.
* [org.openrewrite.codemods.ReactI18Next](/recipes/codemods/reacti18next.md)
  * **React i18next internationalization**
  * Automatically internationalizes React applications by extracting hardcoded strings and replacing them with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com) translation calls. Handles JSX text, attributes, and template literals with variables. Creates and updates a translation JSON file with extracted strings.
* [org.openrewrite.codemods.UI5](/recipes/codemods/ui5.md)
  * **Lint UI5 projects with UI5 linter**
  * Runs the [UI5 Linter](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-linter), a static code analysis tool for UI5 projects. It checks JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, JSON, and other files in your project and reports findings.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies

* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.AddDependency](/recipes/java/dependencies/adddependency.md)
  * **Add Gradle or Maven dependency**
  * For a Gradle project, add a gradle dependency to a `build.gradle` file in the correct configuration based on where it is used. Or For a maven project, Add a Maven dependency to a `pom.xml` file in the correct scope based on where it is used.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyResolutionDiagnostic](/recipes/java/dependencies/dependencyresolutiondiagnostic.md)
  * **Dependency resolution diagnostic**
  * Recipes which manipulate dependencies must be able to successfully access the artifact repositories and resolve dependencies from them. This recipe produces two data tables used to understand the state of dependency resolution.   The Repository accessibility report lists all the artifact repositories known to the project and whether respond to network access. The network access is attempted while the recipe is run and so is representative of current conditions.   The Gradle dependency configuration errors lists all the dependency configurations that failed to resolve one or more dependencies when the project was parsed. This is representative of conditions at the time the LST was parsed.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.RelocatedDependencyCheck](/recipes/java/dependencies/relocateddependencycheck.md)
  * **Find relocated dependencies**
  * Find Maven and Gradle dependencies and Maven plugins that have relocated to a new `groupId` or `artifactId`. Relocation information comes from the [oga-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/oga-maven-plugin/) maintained by Jonathan Lermitage, Filipe Roque and others.  This recipe makes no changes to any source file by default. Add `changeDependencies=true` to change dependencies, but note that you might need to run additional recipes to update imports and adopt other breaking changes.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.RemoveDependency](/recipes/java/dependencies/removedependency.md)
  * **Remove a Gradle or Maven dependency**
  * For Gradle project, removes a single dependency from the dependencies section of the `build.gradle`. For Maven project, removes a single dependency from the `&lt;dependencies&gt;` section of the pom.xml.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.RemoveRedundantDependencies](/recipes/java/dependencies/removeredundantdependencies.md)
  * **Remove redundant explicit dependencies**
  * Remove explicit dependencies that are already provided transitively by a specified dependency. This recipe downloads and resolves the parent dependency's POM to determine its true transitive dependencies, allowing it to detect redundancies even when both dependencies are explicitly declared.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeDependencyVersion](/recipes/java/dependencies/upgradedependencyversion.md)
  * **Upgrade Gradle or Maven dependency versions**
  * For Gradle projects, upgrade the version of a dependency in a `build.gradle` file. Supports updating dependency declarations of various forms:  * `String` notation: `&quot;group:artifact:version&quot;`   * `Map` notation: `group: 'group', name: 'artifact', version: 'version'` It is possible to update version numbers which are defined earlier in the same file in variable declarations.  For Maven projects, upgrade the version of a dependency by specifying a group ID and (optionally) an artifact ID using Node Semver advanced range selectors, allowing more precise control over version updates to patch or minor releases.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion](/recipes/java/dependencies/upgradetransitivedependencyversion.md)
  * **Upgrade transitive Gradle or Maven dependencies**
  * Upgrades the version of a transitive dependency in a Maven pom.xml or Gradle build.gradle. Leaves direct dependencies unmodified. Can be paired with the regular Upgrade Dependency Version recipe to upgrade a dependency everywhere, regardless of whether it is direct or transitive.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindDuplicateClasses](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/findduplicateclasses.md)
  * **Find duplicate classes on the classpath**
  * Detects classes that appear in multiple dependencies on the classpath. This is similar to what the Maven duplicate-finder-maven-plugin does. Duplicate classes can cause runtime issues when different versions of the same class are loaded.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindMinimumDependencyVersion](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumdependencyversion.md)
  * **Find the oldest matching dependency version in use**
  * The oldest dependency version in use is the lowest dependency version in use in any source set of any subproject of a repository. It is possible that, for example, the main source set of a project uses Jackson 2.11, but a test source set uses Jackson 2.16. In this case, the oldest Jackson version in use is Java 2.11.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindMinimumJUnitVersion](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumjunitversion.md)
  * **Find minimum JUnit version**
  * A recipe to find the minimum version of JUnit dependencies. This recipe is designed to return the minimum version of JUnit in a project. It will search for JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 dependencies in the project. If both versions are found, it will return the minimum version of JUnit 4. If a minimumVersion is provided, the recipe will search to see if the minimum version of JUnit used by the project is no lower than the minimumVersion. For example: if the minimumVersion is 4, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 4.12. If the project has only JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 5.7. Another example: if the minimumVersion is 5, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will not return any results.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.ModuleHasDependency](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/modulehasdependency.md)
  * **Module has dependency**
  * Searches for both Gradle and Maven modules that have a dependency matching the specified groupId and artifactId. Places a `SearchResult` marker on all sources within a module with a matching dependency. This recipe is intended to be used as a precondition for other recipes. For example this could be used to limit the application of a spring boot migration to only projects that use spring-boot-starter, limiting unnecessary upgrading. If the search result you want is instead just the build.gradle(.kts) or pom.xml file applying the plugin, use the `FindDependency` recipe instead.
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.RepositoryHasDependency](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/repositoryhasdependency.md)
  * **Repository has dependency**
  * Searches for both Gradle and Maven modules that have a dependency matching the specified groupId and artifactId. Places a `SearchResult` marker on all sources within a repository with a matching dependency. This recipe is intended to be used as a precondition for other recipes. For example this could be used to limit the application of a spring boot migration to only projects that use a springframework dependency, limiting unnecessary upgrading. If the search result you want is instead just the build.gradle(.kts) or pom.xml file applying the plugin, use the `FindDependency` recipe instead.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins

* [org.openrewrite.jenkins.CreateIndexJelly](/recipes/jenkins/createindexjelly.md)
  * **Create `index.jelly` if it doesn't exist**
  * Jenkins tooling [requires](https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-hpi-plugin/pull/302) `src/main/resources/index.jelly` exists with a description.
* [org.openrewrite.jenkins.UpgradeJavaVersion](/recipes/jenkins/upgradejavaversion.md)
  * **Upgrade jenkins java version**
  * Upgrades the version of java specified in Jenkins groovy scripts. Will not downgrade if the version is newer than the specified version.
* [org.openrewrite.jenkins.github.AddTeamToCodeowners](/recipes/jenkins/github/addteamtocodeowners.md)
  * **Add plugin developer team to CODEOWNERS**
  * Adds the `\{artifactId\}-plugin-developers` team to all files in `.github/CODEOWNERS` if absent.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-joda

* [org.openrewrite.java.joda.time.JodaTimeRecipe](/recipes/java/joda/time/jodatimerecipe.md)
  * **Migrate Joda-Time to Java time**
  * Prefer the Java standard library over third-party usage of Joda Time.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-liberty

* [org.openrewrite.java.liberty.RemoveWas2LibertyNonPortableJndiLookup](/recipes/java/liberty/removewas2libertynonportablejndilookup.md)
  * **Removes invalid JNDI properties**
  * Remove the use of invalid JNDI properties from Hashtable.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-micronaut

* [org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.AddAnnotationProcessorPath](/recipes/java/micronaut/addannotationprocessorpath.md)
  * **Add Maven annotation processor path**
  * Add the groupId, artifactId, version, and exclusions of a Maven annotation processor path.
* [org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.AddSnakeYamlDependencyIfNeeded](/recipes/java/micronaut/addsnakeyamldependencyifneeded.md)
  * **Add `snakeyaml` dependency if needed**
  * This recipe will add the `snakeyaml` dependency to a Micronaut 4 application that uses yaml configuration.
* [org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.CopyNonInheritedAnnotations](/recipes/java/micronaut/copynoninheritedannotations.md)
  * **Copy non-inherited annotations from super class**
  * As of Micronaut 3.x only [annotations](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/3.0.x/src/main/docs/guide/appendix/breaks.adoc#annotation-inheritance) that are explicitly meta-annotated with `@Inherited` are inherited from parent classes and interfaces.
* [org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.TypeRequiresIntrospection](/recipes/java/micronaut/typerequiresintrospection.md)
  * **Add `@Introspected` to classes requiring a map representation**
  * In Micronaut 2.x a reflection-based strategy was used to retrieve that information if the class was not annotated with `@Introspected`. As of Micronaut 3.x it is required to annotate classes with `@Introspected` that are used in this way.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java

* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.AddStaticVariableOnProducerSessionBean](/recipes/java/migrate/addstaticvariableonproducersessionbean.md)
  * **Adds `static` modifier to `@Produces` fields that are in session beans**
  * Ensures that the fields annotated with `@Produces` which is inside the session bean (`@Stateless`, `@Stateful`, or `@Singleton`) are declared `static`.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.HasNoJakartaAnnotations](/recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/hasnojakartaannotations.md)
  * **Project has no Jakarta annotations**
  * Mark all source as found per `JavaProject` where no Jakarta annotations are found. This is useful mostly as a precondition for recipes that require Jakarta annotations to be present.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddJaxbRuntime](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/addjaxbruntime.md)
  * **Use latest JAXB API and runtime for Jakarta EE 8**
  * Update build files to use the latest JAXB runtime from Jakarta EE 8 to maintain compatibility with Java version 11 or greater. The recipe will add a JAXB run-time, in Gradle `compileOnly`+`testImplementation` and Maven `provided` scope, to any project that has a transitive dependency on the JAXB API. **The resulting dependencies still use the `javax` namespace, despite the move to the Jakarta artifact**.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddScopeToInjectedClass](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/addscopetoinjectedclass.md)
  * **Add scope annotation to injected classes**
  * Finds member variables annotated with `@Inject' and applies `@Dependent` scope annotation to the variable's type.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToEntity](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtoentity.md)
  * **Unannotated entity attributes require a Transient annotation**
  * In OpenJPA, attributes that are themselves entity classes are not persisted by default. EclipseLink has a different default behavior and tries to persist these attributes to the database. To keep the OpenJPA behavior of ignoring unannotated entity attributes, add the `javax.persistence.Transient` annotation to these attributes in EclipseLink.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveEmbeddableId](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/removeembeddableid.md)
  * **`@Embeddable` classes cannot have an `@Id` annotation when referenced by an `@EmbeddedId` annotation**
  * According to the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, if an entity defines an attribute with an `@EmbeddedId` annotation, the embeddable class cannot contain an attribute with an `@Id` annotation. If both the `@EmbeddedId` annotation and the `@Id` annotation are defined, OpenJPA ignores the `@Id` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.AdoptLombokGetterMethodNames](/recipes/java/migrate/lombok/adoptlombokgettermethodnames.md)
  * **Rename getter methods to fit Lombok**
  * Rename methods that are effectively getter to the name Lombok would give them.  Limitations:  - If two methods in a class are effectively the same getter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.  - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.  - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other. E.g. `int getFoo() \{ return ba; \} int getBa() \{ return foo; \}` stays as it is.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.AdoptLombokSetterMethodNames](/recipes/java/migrate/lombok/adoptlomboksettermethodnames.md)
  * **Rename setter methods to fit Lombok**
  * Rename methods that are effectively setter to the name Lombok would give them. Limitations:  - If two methods in a class are effectively the same setter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.  - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.  - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other. E.g. `int getFoo() \{ return ba; \} int getBa() \{ return foo; \}` stays as it is.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.LombokValueToRecord](/recipes/java/migrate/lombok/lombokvaluetorecord.md)
  * **Convert `@lombok.Value` class to Record**
  * Convert Lombok `@Value` annotated classes to standard Java Records.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.search.PlanJavaMigration](/recipes/java/migrate/search/planjavamigration.md)
  * **Plan a Java version migration**
  * Study the set of Java versions and associated tools in use across many repositories.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-openapi

* [org.openrewrite.openapi.swagger.ConvertApiResponseCodesToStrings](/recipes/openapi/swagger/convertapiresponsecodestostrings.md)
  * **Convert API response codes to strings**
  * Convert API response codes to strings. Handles literal integers, local constant references, and external constant field accesses.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-prethink

* [org.openrewrite.prethink.ExportContext](/recipes/prethink/exportcontext.md)
  * **Export context files**
  * Export DataTables to CSV files in `.moderne/context/` along with a markdown description file. The markdown file describes the context and includes schema information for each data table.
* [org.openrewrite.prethink.UpdateAgentConfig](/recipes/prethink/updateagentconfig.md)
  * **Update agent configuration files**
  * Update coding agent configuration files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.) to include references to Moderne Prethink context files in .moderne/context/.
* [org.openrewrite.prethink.calm.GenerateCalmArchitecture](/recipes/prethink/calm/generatecalmarchitecture.md)
  * **Generate CALM architecture**
  * Generate a FINOS CALM (Common Architecture Language Model) JSON file from discovered service endpoints, database connections, external service calls, and messaging connections.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-rewrite

* [org.openrewrite.java.recipes.ExamplesExtractor](/recipes/java/recipes/examplesextractor.md)
  * **Extract documentation examples from tests**
  * Extract the before/after sources from tests annotated with `@DocumentExample`, and generate a YAML file with those examples to be shown in the documentation to show usage.
* [org.openrewrite.java.recipes.GenerateDeprecatedMethodRecipes](/recipes/java/recipes/generatedeprecatedmethodrecipes.md)
  * **Generate `InlineMethodCalls` recipes for deprecated delegating methods**
  * Finds `@Deprecated` method declarations whose body is a single delegation call to another method in the same class, and generates a declarative YAML recipe file containing `InlineMethodCalls` entries for each.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring

* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.RenameBean](/recipes/java/spring/renamebean.md)
  * **Rename bean**
  * Renames a Spring bean, both declaration and references.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.SeparateApplicationPropertiesByProfile](/recipes/java/spring/separateapplicationpropertiesbyprofile.md)
  * **Separate `application.properties` by profile**
  * Separating `application.properties` into separate files based on profiles.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.SeparateApplicationYamlByProfile](/recipes/java/spring/separateapplicationyamlbyprofile.md)
  * **Separate application YAML by profile**
  * The Spring team's recommendation is to separate profile properties into their own YAML files now.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.UpdateApiManifest](/recipes/java/spring/updateapimanifest.md)
  * **Update the API manifest**
  * Keep a consolidated manifest of the API endpoints that this application exposes up-to-date.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.MergeBootstrapYamlWithApplicationYaml](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/mergebootstrapyamlwithapplicationyaml.md)
  * **Merge Spring `bootstrap.yml` with `application.yml`**
  * In Spring Boot 2.4, support for `bootstrap.yml` was removed. It's properties should be merged with `application.yml`.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.MoveAutoConfigurationToImportsFile](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/moveautoconfigurationtoimportsfile.md)
  * **Use `AutoConfiguration#imports`**
  * Use `AutoConfiguration#imports` instead of the deprecated entry `EnableAutoConfiguration` in `spring.factories` when defining autoconfiguration classes.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.IntegrationSchedulerPoolRecipe](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/integrationschedulerpoolrecipe.md)
  * **Integration scheduler pool size**
  * Spring Integration now reuses an available `TaskScheduler` rather than configuring its own. In a typical application setup relying on the auto-configuration, this means that Spring Integration uses the auto-configured task scheduler that has a pool size of 1. To restore Spring Integration’s default of 10 threads, use the `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size` property.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.LoggingShutdownHooks](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/loggingshutdownhooks.md)
  * **Applications using logging shutdown hooks**
  * Spring Boot registers a logging shutdown hook by default for JAR-based applications to ensure that logging resources are released when the JVM exits. If your application is deployed as a WAR then the shutdown hook is not registered since the servlet container usually handles logging concerns.   Most applications will want the shutdown hook. However, if your application has complex context hierarchies, then you may need to disable it. You can use the `logging.register-shutdown-hook` property to do that.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.MaintainTrailingSlashURLMappings](/recipes/java/spring/boot3/maintaintrailingslashurlmappings.md)
  * **Maintain trailing slash URL mappings**
  * This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping(&quot;/some/greeting&quot;)` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is to maintain trailing slash in all HTTP url mappings.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.MigrateHooksToReactorContextProperty](/recipes/java/spring/boot3/migratehookstoreactorcontextproperty.md)
  * **Use `spring.reactor.context-propagation` property**
  * Replace `Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation()` with `spring.reactor.context-propagation=true`.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.cloud2022.AddLoggingPatternLevelForSleuth](/recipes/java/spring/cloud2022/addloggingpatternlevelforsleuth.md)
  * **Add logging.pattern.level for traceId and spanId**
  * Add `logging.pattern.level` for traceId and spanId which was previously set by default, if not already set.
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.doc.MigrateDocketBeanToGroupedOpenApiBean](/recipes/java/spring/doc/migratedocketbeantogroupedopenapibean.md)
  * **Migrate `Docket` to `GroupedOpenAPI`**
  * Migrate a `Docket` bean to a `GroupedOpenAPI` bean preserving group name, packages and paths. When possible the recipe will prefer property based configuration.
* [org.openrewrite.maven.spring.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependencies](/recipes/maven/spring/upgradeexplicitspringbootdependencies.md)
  * **Upgrade Spring dependencies**
  * Upgrades dependencies according to the specified version of spring boot. Spring boot has many direct and transitive dependencies. When a module has an explicit dependency on one of these it may also need to be upgraded to match the version used by spring boot.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis

* [org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.LowercasePackage](/recipes/staticanalysis/lowercasepackage.md)
  * **Rename packages to lowercase**
  * By convention all Java package names should contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. This recipe converts any uppercase letters in package names to be lowercase.
* [org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.MethodNameCasing](/recipes/staticanalysis/methodnamecasing.md)
  * **Standardize method name casing**
  * Fixes method names that do not follow standard naming conventions. For example, `String getFoo_bar()` would be adjusted to `String getFooBar()` and `int DoSomething()` would be adjusted to `int doSomething()`.

## org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-testing-frameworks

* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.cleanup.TestsShouldNotBePublic](/recipes/java/testing/cleanup/testsshouldnotbepublic.md)
  * **Remove `public` visibility of JUnit 5 tests**
  * Remove `public` and optionally `protected` modifiers from methods with `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@TestFactory`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll`. They no longer have to be public visibility to be usable by JUnit 5.
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddHamcrestJUnitDependency](/recipes/java/testing/junit5/addhamcrestjunitdependency.md)
  * **Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency**
  * Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency only if JUnit 4's `assertThat` or `assumeThat` is used.
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddJupiterDependencies](/recipes/java/testing/junit5/addjupiterdependencies.md)
  * **Add JUnit Jupiter dependencies**
  * Adds JUnit Jupiter dependencies to a Maven or Gradle project. JUnit Jupiter can be added either with the artifact `junit-jupiter`, or both of `junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-engine`. This adds `junit-jupiter` dependency unless `junit-jupiter-api` or `junit-jupiter-engine` are already present.
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.mockito.AnyToNullable](/recipes/java/testing/mockito/anytonullable.md)
  * **Replace Mockito 1.x `anyString()`/`any()` with `nullable(Class)`**
  * Since Mockito 2.10 `anyString()` and `any()` no longer matches null values. Use `nullable(Class)` instead.
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.mockito.VerifyZeroToNoMoreInteractions](/recipes/java/testing/mockito/verifyzerotonomoreinteractions.md)
  * **Replace `verifyZeroInteractions()` with `verifyNoMoreInteractions()`**
  * Replaces `verifyZeroInteractions()` with `verifyNoMoreInteractions()` in Mockito tests when migration when using a Mockito version &lt; 3.x.

## org.openrewrite:rewrite-core

* [org.openrewrite.AddToGitignore](/recipes/core/addtogitignore.md)
  * **Add entries to `.gitignore`**
  * Adds entries to the project's `.gitignore` file. If no `.gitignore` file exists, one will be created. Existing entries that match will not be duplicated.
* [org.openrewrite.ExcludeFileFromGitignore](/recipes/core/excludefilefromgitignore.md)
  * **Remove ignoral of files or directories from .gitignore**
  * This recipe will remove a file or directory from the .gitignore file. If the file or directory is already in the .gitignore file, it will be removed or negated. If the file or directory is not in the .gitignore file, no action will be taken.
* [org.openrewrite.FindCollidingSourceFiles](/recipes/core/findcollidingsourcefiles.md)
  * **Find colliding source files**
  * Finds source files which share a path with another source file. There should always be exactly one source file per path within a repository. This is a diagnostic for finding problems in OpenRewrite parsers/build plugins.
* [org.openrewrite.FindGitProvenance](/recipes/core/findgitprovenance.md)
  * **Show Git source control metadata**
  * List out the contents of each unique `GitProvenance` marker in the set of source files. When everything is working correctly, exactly one such marker should be printed as all source files are expected to come from the same repository / branch / commit hash.
* [org.openrewrite.FindLstProvenance](/recipes/core/findlstprovenance.md)
  * **Find LST provenance**
  * Produces a data table showing what versions of OpenRewrite/Moderne tooling was used to produce a given LST.
* [org.openrewrite.ListRuntimeClasspath](/recipes/core/listruntimeclasspath.md)
  * **List runtime classpath**
  * A diagnostic utility which emits the runtime classpath to a data table.
* [org.openrewrite.search.FindCommitters](/recipes/search/findcommitters.md)
  * **Find committers on repositories**
  * List the committers on a repository.
* [org.openrewrite.search.RepositoryContainsFile](/recipes/search/repositorycontainsfile.md)
  * **Repository contains file**
  * Intended to be used primarily as a precondition for other recipes, this recipe checks if a repository contains a specific file or files matching a pattern. If present all files in the repository are marked with a `SearchResult` marker. If you want to get only the matching file as a search result, use `FindSourceFiles` instead.
* [org.openrewrite.text.AppendToTextFile](/recipes/text/appendtotextfile.md)
  * **Append to text file**
  * Appends or replaces content of an existing plain text file, or creates a new one if it doesn't already exist. Please note that this recipes requires existing plain text files' format to be successfully parsable by OpenRewrite. If a file is left unchanged, it might be parsed as a `Quark` rather than plain text. In such case, use the `plainTextMask` option. See the [Gradle](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/gradle-plugin-configuration#configuring-the-rewrite-dsl) or [Maven](https://openrewrite.github.io/rewrite-maven-plugin/run-mojo.html#plainTextMasks) plugin configuration page.
* [org.openrewrite.text.CreateTextFile](/recipes/text/createtextfile.md)
  * **Create text file**
  * Creates a new plain text file.

## org.openrewrite:rewrite-csharp

* [org.openrewrite.csharp.recipes.meziantou.analyzer.AbstractTypesShouldNotHaveConstructorsMA0017](/recipes/csharp/recipes/meziantou/analyzer/abstracttypesshouldnothaveconstructorsma0017.md)
  * **Abstract types should not have public or internal constructors**
  * 
* [org.openrewrite.csharp.recipes.meziantou.analyzer.ArgumentExceptionShouldSpecifyArgumentNameMA0043](/recipes/csharp/recipes/meziantou/analyzer/argumentexceptionshouldspecifyargumentnamema0043.md)
  * **Use nameof operator in ArgumentException**
  *

  * **Override equals and operator equals on value types**
  * For value types, the inherited implementation of Equals uses the Reflection library and compares the contents of all fields. Reflection is computationally expensive, and comparing every field for equality might be unnecessary.

  * When an asynchronous method awaits a Task directly, continuation occurs in the same thread that created the task. Consider calling Task.ConfigureAwait(Boolean) to signal your intention for continuation. Call ConfigureAwait(false) on the task to schedule continuations to the thread pool, thereby avoiding a deadlock on the UI thread. Passing false is a good option for app-independent libraries. Calling ConfigureAwait(true) on the task has the same behavior as not explicitly calling ConfigureAwait.

  * **Implement IEquatable when overriding Object.Equals**
  * When a type T overrides Object.Equals(object), the implementation must cast the object argument to the correct type T before performing the comparison. If the type implements IEquatable&lt;T&gt;, and therefore offers the method T.Equals(T), and if the argument is known at compile time to be of type T, then the compiler can call IEquatable&lt;T&gt;.Equals(T) instead of Object.Equals(object), and no cast is necessary, improving performance.

  * **Update Gradle wrapper**
  * Update the version of Gradle used in an existing Gradle wrapper. Queries services.gradle.org to determine the available releases, but prefers the artifact repository URL which already exists within the wrapper properties file. If your artifact repository does not contain the same Gradle distributions as services.gradle.org, then the recipe may suggest a version which is not available in your artifact repository.
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.UpgradeDependencyVersion](/recipes/gradle/upgradedependencyversion.md)
  * **Upgrade Gradle dependency versions**
  * Upgrade the version of a dependency in a build.gradle file.

  * Searches for Gradle Projects (modules) that have a dependency matching the specified id or implementing class. Places a `SearchResult` marker on all sources within a project with a matching dependency. This recipe is intended to be used as a precondition for other recipes. For example this could be used to limit the application of a spring boot migration to only projects that use spring-boot-starter, limiting unnecessary upgrading. If the search result you want is instead just the build.gradle(.kts) file that use the dependency, use the `FindDependency` recipe instead.
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.search.ModuleHasPlugin](/recipes/gradle/search/modulehasplugin.md)
  * **Module has plugin**
  * Searches for Gradle Projects (modules) that have a plugin matching the specified id or implementing class. Places a `SearchResult` marker on all sources within a project with a matching plugin. This recipe is intended to be used as a precondition for other recipes. For example this could be used to limit the application of a spring boot migration to only projects that apply the spring dependency management plugin, limiting unnecessary upgrading. If the search result you want is instead just the build.gradle(.kts) file applying the plugin, use the `FindPlugins` recipe instead.
