### [Show Git source control metadata](../recipes/core/findgitprovenance.md)
_org.openrewrite.FindGitProvenance_

List out the contents of each unique `GitProvenance` marker in the set of source files. When everything is working correctly, exactly one such marker should be printed as all source files are expected to come from the same repository / branch / commit hash.

### [Find LST provenance](../recipes/core/findlstprovenance.md)

Intended to be used primarily as a precondition for other recipes, this recipe checks if a repository contains a specific file or files matching a pattern. If present all files in the repository are marked with a `SearchResult` marker. If you want to get only the matching file as a search result, use `FindSourceFiles` instead.

### [Append to text file](../recipes/text/appendtotextfile.md)
_org.openrewrite.text.AppendToTextFile_

Appends or replaces content of an existing plain text file, or creates a new one if it doesn't already exist. Please note that this recipes requires existing plain text files' format to be successfully parsable by OpenRewrite. If a file is left unchanged, it might be parsed as a `Quark` rather than plain text. In such case, use the `plainTextMask` option. See the [Gradle](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/gradle-plugin-configuration#configuring-the-rewrite-dsl) or [Maven](https://openrewrite.github.io/rewrite-maven-plugin/run-mojo.html#plainTextMasks) plugin configuration page.

Queries services.gradle.org to determine the available releases, but prefers the artifact repository URL which already exists within the wrapper properties file. If your artifact repository does not contain the same Gradle distributions as services.gradle.org, then the recipe may suggest a version which is not available in your artifact repository.

### [Upgrade Gradle dependency versions](../recipes/gradle/upgradedependencyversion.md)
_org.openrewrite.gradle.UpgradeDependencyVersion_

Upgrade the version of a dependency in a build.gradle file. Supports updating dependency declarations of various forms:

### [Unannotated entity attributes require a Transient annotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtoentity.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToEntity_

In OpenJPA, attributes that are themselves entity classes are not persisted by default. EclipseLink has a different default behavior and tries to persist these attributes to the database. To keep the OpenJPA behavior of ignoring unannotated entity attributes, add the `javax.persistence.Transient` annotation to these attributes in EclipseLink.

### [`@Embeddable` classes cannot have an `@Id` annotation when referenced by an `@EmbeddedId` annotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/removeembeddableid.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveEmbeddableId_

According to the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, if an entity defines an attribute with an `@EmbeddedId` annotation, the embeddable class cannot contain an attribute with an `@Id` annotation. If both the `@EmbeddedId` annotation and the `@Id` annotation are defined, OpenJPA ignores the `@Id` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception.

### [Migrate Joda-Time to Java time](../recipes/java/migrate/joda/jodatimerecipe.md)

_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.AdoptLombokGetterMethodNames_

Rename methods that are effectively getter to the name Lombok would give them.

Limitations:
 - If two methods in a class are effectively the same getter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.
 - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.
 - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other.
E.g. `int getFoo() { return ba; } int getBa() { return foo; }` stays as it is.

### [Separate application YAML by profile](../recipes/java/spring/separateapplicationyamlbyprofile.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.SeparateApplicationYamlByProfile_

The Spring team's recommendation is to separate profile properties into their own YAML files now.

### [Update the API manifest](../recipes/java/spring/updateapimanifest.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.UpdateApiManifest_

Keep a consolidated manifest of the API endpoints that this application exposes up-to-date.

### [Merge Spring `bootstrap.yml` with `application.yml`](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/mergebootstrapyamlwithapplicationyaml.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.MergeBootstrapYamlWithApplicationYaml_

In Spring Boot 2.4, support for `bootstrap.yml` was removed. It's properties should be merged with `application.yml`.

### [Use `AutoConfiguration#imports`](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/moveautoconfigurationtoimportsfile.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.MoveAutoConfigurationToImportsFile_

Use `AutoConfiguration#imports` instead of the deprecated entry `EnableAutoConfiguration` in `spring.factories` when defining autoconfiguration classes.

### [Integration scheduler pool size](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/integrationschedulerpoolrecipe.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.IntegrationSchedulerPoolRecipe_

Spring Integration now reuses an available `TaskScheduler` rather than configuring its own. In a typical application setup relying on the auto-configuration, this means that Spring Integration uses the auto-configured task scheduler that has a pool size of 1. To restore Spring Integration’s default of 10 threads, use the `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size` property.

### [Applications using logging shutdown hooks](../recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/loggingshutdownhooks.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.LoggingShutdownHooks_

Spring Boot registers a logging shutdown hook by default for JAR-based applications to ensure that logging resources are released when the JVM exits. If your application is deployed as a WAR then the shutdown hook is not registered since the servlet container usually handles logging concerns. 

Most applications will want the shutdown hook. However, if your application has complex context hierarchies, then you may need to disable it. You can use the `logging.register-shutdown-hook` property to do that.

### [Maintain trailing slash URL mappings](../recipes/java/spring/boot3/maintaintrailingslashurlmappings.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.MaintainTrailingSlashURLMappings_

This is part of Spring MVC and WebFlux URL Matching Changes, as of Spring Framework 6.0, the trailing slash matching configuration option has been deprecated and its default value set to false. This means that previously, a controller `@GetMapping("/some/greeting")` would match both `GET /some/greeting` and `GET /some/greeting/`, but it doesn't match `GET /some/greeting/` anymore by default and will result in an HTTP 404 error. This recipe is to maintain trailing slash in all HTTP url mappings.

### [Add logging.pattern.level for traceId and spanId](../recipes/java/spring/cloud2022/addloggingpatternlevelforsleuth.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.cloud2022.AddLoggingPatternLevelForSleuth_

Add `logging.pattern.level` for traceId and spanId which was previously set by default, if not already set.

### [Replace String literals with `HttpHeaders` constants](../recipes/java/spring/http/replacestringliteralswithhttpheadersconstants.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.http.ReplaceStringLiteralsWithHttpHeadersConstants_

Replace String literals with `org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders` constants.

### [Replace String literals with `MediaType` constants](../recipes/java/spring/http/replacestringliteralswithmediatypeconstants.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.http.ReplaceStringLiteralsWithMediaTypeConstants_

Replace String literals with `org.springframework.http.MediaType` constants.

### [Upgrade Spring dependencies](../recipes/maven/spring/upgradeexplicitspringbootdependencies.md)
_org.openrewrite.maven.spring.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependencies_

Upgrades dependencies according to the specified version of spring boot. Spring boot has many direct and transitive dependencies. When a module has an explicit dependency on one of these it may also need to be upgraded to match the version used by spring boot.

### [Rename packages to lowercase](../recipes/staticanalysis/lowercasepackage.md)
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.LowercasePackage_

By convention all Java package names should contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. This recipe converts any uppercase letters in package names to be lowercase.

### [Standardize method name casing](../recipes/staticanalysis/methodnamecasing.md)
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.MethodNameCasing_

Fixes method names that do not follow standard naming conventions. For example, `String getFoo_bar()` would be adjusted to `String getFooBar()` and `int DoSomething()` would be adjusted to `int doSomething()`.

### [Remove `public` visibility of JUnit 5 tests](../recipes/java/testing/cleanup/testsshouldnotbepublic.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.cleanup.TestsShouldNotBePublic_

Remove `public` and optionally `protected` modifiers from methods with `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@TestFactory`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll`. They no longer have to be public visibility to be usable by JUnit 5.

### [Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency](../recipes/java/testing/junit5/addhamcrestjunitdependency.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddHamcrestJUnitDependency_

Add Hamcrest JUnit dependency only if JUnit 4's `assertThat` or `assumeThat` is used.

### [Add JUnit Jupiter dependencies](../recipes/java/testing/junit5/addjupiterdependencies.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddJupiterDependencies_

Adds JUnit Jupiter dependencies to a Maven or Gradle project. Junit Jupiter can be added either with the artifact junit-jupiter, or both of junit-jupiter-api and junit-jupiter-engine. This adds "junit-jupiter" dependency unless "junit-jupiter-api" or "junit-jupiter-engine" are already present.

### [Replace Mockito 1.x `anyString()`/`any()` with `nullable(Class)`](../recipes/java/testing/mockito/anytonullable.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.mockito.AnyToNullable_

Since Mockito 2.10 `anyString()` and `any()` no longer matches null values. Use `nullable(Class)` instead.

### [Replace `verifyZeroInteractions()` to `verifyNoMoreInteractions()](../recipes/java/testing/mockito/verifyzerotonomoreinteractions.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.mockito.VerifyZeroToNoMoreInteractions_

Replaces `verifyZeroInteractions()` with `verifyNoMoreInteractions()` in Mockito tests when migration when using a Mockito version < 3.x.

### [Find unit tests](../recipes/java/testing/search/findunittests.md)
_org.openrewrite.java.testing.search.FindUnitTests_

Produces a data table showing how methods are used in unit tests.
