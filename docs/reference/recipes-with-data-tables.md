This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence. The recipe has an option to limit fixes to only those vulnerabilities that have evidence of exploitation at various levels of severity.

### [Find parse to print inequality](/recipes/search/findparsetoprintinequality.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.search.FindParseToPrintInequality_

OpenRewrite `Parser` implementations should produce `SourceFile` objects whose `printAll()` method should be byte-for-byte equivalent with the original source file. When this isn't true, recipes can still run on the `SourceFile` and even produce diffs, but the diffs would fail to apply as a patch to the original source file. Most `Parser` use `Parser#requirePrintEqualsInput` to produce a `ParseError` when they fail to produce a `SourceFile` that is print idempotent.

#### Data tables:

  * **org.openrewrite.table.ParseToPrintInequalities**: *A list of files that parsers produced `SourceFile` which, when printed, didn't match the original source code.*

If present all files in the repository are marked with a `SearchResult` marker. If you want to get only the matching file as a search result, use `FindSourceFiles` instead.

#### Data tables:

  * **org.openrewrite.table.SearchResults**: *Search results that were found during the recipe run.*


### [Append to text file](/recipes/text/appendtotextfile.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.text.AppendToTextFile_

Appends or replaces content of an existing plain text file, or creates a new one if it doesn't already exist. Please note that this recipes requires existing plain text files' format to be successfully parsable by OpenRewrite. If a file is left unchanged, it might be parsed as a `Quark` rather than plain text. In such case, use the `plainTextMask` option. See the [Gradle](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/gradle-plugin-configuration#configuring-the-rewrite-dsl) or [Maven](https://openrewrite.github.io/rewrite-maven-plugin/run-mojo.html#plainTextMasks) plugin configuration page.

The .NET runtime initializes all fields of reference types to their default values before running the constructor. In most cases, explicitly initializing a field to its default value in a constructor is redundant, adding maintenance costs and potentially degrading performance (such as with increased assembly size), and the explicit initialization can be removed.  In some cases, such as with static readonly fields that permanently retain their default value, consider instead changing them to be constants or properties.

_org.openrewrite.csharp.recipes.microsoft.codeanalysis.netanalyzers.CSharpDynamicInterfaceCastableImplementationCA2256_

Types attributed with 'DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementationAttribute' act as an interface implementation for a type that implements the 'IDynamicInterfaceCastable' type. As a result, it must provide an implementation of all of the members defined in the inherited interfaces, because the type that implements 'IDynamicInterfaceCastable' will not provide them otherwise.

The default value of an uninitialized enumeration, just as other value types, is zero. A nonflags-attributed enumeration should define a member by using the value of zero so that the default value is a valid value of the enumeration. If an enumeration that has the FlagsAttribute attribute applied defines a zero-valued member, its name should be &quot;&quot;None&quot;&quot; to indicate that no values have been set in the enumeration.

For value types, the inherited implementation of Equals uses the Reflection library and compares the contents of all fields. Reflection is computationally expensive, and comparing every field for equality might be unnecessary. If you expect users to compare or sort instances, or to use instances as hash table keys, your value type should implement Equals.

### [Use the 'StringComparison' method overloads to perform case-insensitive string comparisons](/recipes/csharp/recipes/microsoft/codeanalysis/netanalyzers/csharprecommendcaseinsensitivestringcomparisonca1862.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.csharp.recipes.microsoft.codeanalysis.netanalyzers.CSharpRecommendCaseInsensitiveStringComparisonCA1862_

Avoid calling 'ToLower', 'ToUpper', 'ToLowerInvariant' and 'ToUpperInvariant' to perform case-insensitive string comparisons because they lead to an allocation. Instead, prefer calling the method overloads of 'Contains', 'IndexOf' and 'StartsWith' that take a 'StringComparison' enum value to perform case-insensitive comparisons. Switching to using an overload that takes a 'StringComparison' might cause subtle changes in behavior, so it's important to conduct thorough testing after applying the suggestion. Additionally, if a culturally sensitive comparison is not required, consider using 'StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase'.

A field is declared static and read-only (Shared and ReadOnly in Visual Basic), and is initialized by using a value that is computable at compile time. Because the value that is assigned to the targeted field is computable at compile time, change the declaration to a const (Const in Visual Basic) field so that the value is computed at compile time instead of at runtime.

When an asynchronous method awaits a Task directly, continuation occurs in the same thread that created the task. Consider calling Task.ConfigureAwait(Boolean) to signal your intention for continuation. Call ConfigureAwait(false) on the task to schedule continuations to the thread pool, thereby avoiding a deadlock on the UI thread. Passing false is a good option for app-independent libraries. Calling ConfigureAwait(true) on the task has the same behavior as not explicitly calling ConfigureAwait. By explicitly calling this method, you're letting readers know you intentionally want to perform the continuation on the original synchronization context.

_org.openrewrite.csharp.recipes.microsoft.codeanalysis.netanalyzers.EquatableCA1066_

When a type T overrides Object.Equals(object), the implementation must cast the object argument to the correct type T before performing the comparison. If the type implements IEquatable&lt;T&gt;, and therefore offers the method T.Equals(T), and if the argument is known at compile time to be of type T, then the compiler can call IEquatable&lt;T&gt;.Equals(T) instead of Object.Equals(object), and no cast is necessary, improving performance.

### [Dependency constraint to resolution rule](/recipes/gradle/dependencyconstrainttorule.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.gradle.DependencyConstraintToRule_

Gradle [dependency constraints](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_constraints.html#dependency-constraints) are useful for managing the versions of transitive dependencies. Some plugins, such as the Spring Dependency Management plugin, do not respect these constraints. This recipe converts constraints into [resolution rules](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/resolution_rules.html), which can achieve similar effects to constraints but are harder for plugins to ignore.

### [Structural equality tests should use `==` or `!=`](/recipes/kotlin/cleanup/equalsmethodusage.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.kotlin.cleanup.EqualsMethodUsage_

In Kotlin, `==` means structural equality and `!=` structural inequality and both map to the left-side term’s `equals()` function. It is, therefore, redundant to call `equals()` as a function. Also, `==` and `!=` are more general than `equals()` and `!equals()` because it allows either of both operands to be `null`. Developers using `equals()` instead of `==` or `!=` is often the result of adapting styles from other languages like Java, where `==` means reference equality and `!=` means reference inequality. The `==` and `!=` operators are a more concise and elegant way to test structural equality than calling a function.

### [`it` shouldn't be used as a lambda parameter name](/recipes/kotlin/cleanup/implicitparameterinlambda.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.kotlin.cleanup.ImplicitParameterInLambda_

`it` is a special identifier that allows you to refer to the current parameter being passed to a lambda expression without explicitly naming the parameter. Lambda expressions are a concise way of writing anonymous functions. Many lambda expressions have only one parameter, when this is true the compiler can determine the parameter type by context. Thus when using it with single parameter lambda expressions, you do not need to declare the type.

_org.openrewrite.maven.search.ModuleHasDependency_

Searches for Maven modules that have a dependency matching the specified groupId and artifactId. Places a `SearchResult` marker on all sources within a module with a matching dependency. This recipe is intended to be used as a precondition for other recipes. For example this could be used to limit the application of a spring boot migration to only projects that use spring-boot-starter, limiting unnecessary upgrading. If the search result you want is instead just the build.gradle(.kts) file applying the plugin, use the `FindDependency` recipe instead.

### [Adds a TimeUnit argument to the matched method invocations](/recipes/apache/httpclient5/addtimeunitargument.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.apache.httpclient5.AddTimeUnitArgument_

In Apache Http Client 5.x migration, an extra TimeUnit argument is required in the timeout and duration methods. Previously in 4.x, all these methods were implicitly having the timeout or duration expressed in milliseconds, but in 5.x the unit of the timeout or duration is required. So, by default this recipe adds `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`, it is possible to specify this as a parameter. Since all affected methods of the Apache Http Client 5.x migration only have one integer/long argument, the recipe applies with matched method invocations of exactly one parameter.

#### Data tables:

  * **org.openrewrite.table.SearchResults**: *Search results that were found during the recipe run.*


### [Changes an argument to a `TimeValue` for matched method invocations](/recipes/apache/httpclient5/changeargumenttotimevalue.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.apache.httpclient5.ChangeArgumentToTimeValue_

In Apache Http Client 5.x migration, some methods that previously took a single long argument have changed to take a `TimeValue`. Previously in 4.x, all these methods were implicitly having the value expressed in milliseconds. By default this recipe uses `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS` for the `TimeUnit` when creating a `TimeValue`. It is possible to specify this as a parameter. Since all affected methods of the Apache Http Client 5.x migration only have one long argument, the recipe applies with matched method invocations of exactly one parameter.

_org.openrewrite.apache.httpclient5.NewRequestLine_

`HttpRequestBase::getStatusLine()` was deprecated in 4.x, so we replace it with `new RequestLine(HttpRequest)`. Ideally we will try to simply method chains for `getMethod`, `getUri` and `getProtocolVersion`, but there are some scenarios where `RequestLine` object is assigned or used directly, and we need to instantiate the object.

### [Dependency resolution diagnostic](/recipes/java/dependencies/dependencyresolutiondiagnostic.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyResolutionDiagnostic_

Recipes which manipulate dependencies must be able to successfully access the artifact repositories and resolve dependencies from them. This recipe produces two data tables used to understand the state of dependency resolution.   The Repository accessibility report lists all the artifact repositories known to the project and whether respond to network access. The network access is attempted while the recipe is run and so is representative of current conditions.   The Gradle dependency configuration errors lists all the dependency configurations that failed to resolve one or more dependencies when the project was parsed. This is representative of conditions at the time the LST was parsed.

#### Data tables:

  * **org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.table.RepositoryAccessibilityReport**: *Listing of all dependency repositories and whether they are accessible.*
  * **org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.table.GradleDependencyConfigurationErrors**: *Records Gradle dependency configurations which failed to resolve during parsing. Partial success/failure is common, a failure in this list does not mean that every dependency failed to resolve.*

### [Find the oldest matching dependency version in use](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumdependencyversion.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindMinimumDependencyVersion_

The oldest dependency version in use is the lowest dependency version in use in any source set of any subproject of a repository. It is possible that, for example, the main source set of a project uses Jackson 2.11, but a test source set uses Jackson 2.16. In this case, the oldest Jackson version in use is Java 2.11.

#### Data tables:

  * **org.openrewrite.maven.table.DependenciesInUse**: *Direct and transitive dependencies in use.*

### [Find minimum JUnit version](/recipes/java/dependencies/search/findminimumjunitversion.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.search.FindMinimumJUnitVersion_

A recipe to find the minimum version of JUnit dependencies. This recipe is designed to return the minimum version of JUnit in a project. It will search for JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 dependencies in the project. If both versions are found, it will return the minimum version of JUnit 4. If a minimumVersion is provided, the recipe will search to see if the minimum version of JUnit used by the project is no lower than the minimumVersion. For example: if the minimumVersion is 4, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 4.12. If the project has only JUnit 5.7, the recipe will return JUnit 5.7. Another example: if the minimumVersion is 5, and the project has JUnit 4.12 and JUnit 5.7, the recipe will not return any results.

### [Partial path traversal vulnerability](/recipes/java/security/partialpathtraversalvulnerability.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.security.PartialPathTraversalVulnerability_

Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath()`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.  To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `&quot;/usr/outnot&quot;.startsWith(&quot;/usr/out&quot;)`. The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory. It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object. For example, on Linux, `println(new File(&quot;/var&quot;))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(&quot;/var&quot;, &quot;/&quot;)` will print `/var/`; however, `println(new File(&quot;/var&quot;, &quot;/&quot;).getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

### [Secure Spring service exporters](/recipes/java/security/spring/insecurespringserviceexporter.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.security.spring.InsecureSpringServiceExporter_

The default Java deserialization mechanism is available via `ObjectInputStream` class. This mechanism is known to be vulnerable. If an attacker can make an application deserialize malicious data, it may result in arbitrary code execution.  Spring’s `RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter` uses the default Java deserialization mechanism to parse data. As a result, all classes that extend it are vulnerable to deserialization attacks. The Spring Framework contains at least `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` and `SimpleHttpInvokerServiceExporter` that extend `RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter`. These exporters parse data from the HTTP body using the unsafe Java deserialization mechanism.  See the full [blog post](https://blog.gypsyengineer.com/en/security/detecting-dangerous-spring-exporters-with-codeql.html) by Artem Smotrakov on CVE-2016-1000027 from which the above description is excerpted.

This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable.

#### Data tables:

### [Find and fix vulnerable dependencies](/recipes/java/dependencies/dependencyvulnerabilitycheck.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck_

This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Upgrades dependencies versioned according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).   ## Customizing Vulnerability Data  This recipe can be customized by extending `DependencyVulnerabilityCheckBase` and overriding the vulnerability data sources:   - **`baselineVulnerabilities(ExecutionContext ctx)`**: Provides the default set of known vulnerabilities. The base implementation loads vulnerability data from the GitHub Security Advisory Database CSV file using `ResourceUtils.parseResourceAsCsv()`. Override this method to replace the entire vulnerability dataset with your own curated list.   - **`supplementalVulnerabilities(ExecutionContext ctx)`**: Allows adding custom vulnerability data beyond the baseline. The base implementation returns an empty list. Override this method to add organization-specific vulnerabilities, internal security advisories, or vulnerabilities from additional sources while retaining the baseline GitHub Advisory Database.  Both methods return `List&lt;Vulnerability&gt;` objects. Vulnerability data can be loaded from CSV files using `ResourceUtils.parseResourceAsCsv(path, Vulnerability.class, consumer)` or constructed programmatically. To customize, extend `DependencyVulnerabilityCheckBase` and override one or both methods depending on your needs. For example, override `supplementalVulnerabilities()` to add custom CVEs while keeping the standard vulnerability database, or override `baselineVulnerabilities()` to use an entirely different vulnerability data source.

_org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.RemoveUnusedDependencies_

Scans through source code collecting references to types and methods, removing any dependencies that are not used from Maven or Gradle build files. This recipe takes reflective access into account: When reflective access to a class is made unambiguously via a string literal, such as: `Class.forName(&quot;java.util.List&quot;)` that is counted correctly. When reflective access to a class is made ambiguously via anything other than a string literal no dependencies will be removed. This recipe takes transitive dependencies into account: When a direct dependency is not used but a transitive dependency it brings in _is_ in use the direct dependency is not removed.

Migrates custom Log4j 2.x Appender components to `logback-classic`. This recipe operates on the following assumptions: 1.) The contents of the `append()` method remains unchanged. 2.) The `requiresLayout()` method is not used in logback and can be removed. 3.) In logback, the `stop()` method is the equivalent of log4j's close() method. For more details, see this page from logback: [`Migration from log4j`](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/migrationFromLog4j.html).

### [Migrate Log4j 2.x Layout to logback-classic equivalents](/recipes/java/logging/logback/log4jlayouttologback.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.logging.logback.Log4jLayoutToLogback_

Migrates custom Log4j 2.x Layout components to `logback-classic`. This recipe operates on the following assumptions: 1. A logback-classic layout must extend the `LayoutBase&lt;ILoggingEvent&gt;` class. 2. log4j's `format()` is renamed to `doLayout()` in a logback-classic layout. 3. LoggingEvent `getRenderedMessage()` is converted to LoggingEvent `getMessage()`. 4. The log4j ignoresThrowable() method is not needed and has no equivalent in logback-classic. 5. The activateOptions() method merits further discussion. In log4j, a layout will have its activateOptions() method invoked by log4j configurators, that is PropertyConfigurator or DOMConfigurator just after all the options of the layout have been set. Thus, the layout will have an opportunity to check that its options are coherent and if so, proceed to fully initialize itself. 6. In logback-classic, layouts must implement the LifeCycle interface which includes a method called start(). The start() method is the equivalent of log4j's activateOptions() method. For more details, see this page from logback: [`Migration from log4j`](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/migrationFromLog4j.html).

### [Enhances logging of exceptions by including the full stack trace in addition to the exception message](/recipes/java/logging/slf4j/completeexceptionlogging.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.logging.slf4j.CompleteExceptionLogging_

It is a common mistake to call `Exception.getMessage()` when passing an exception into a log method. Not all exception types have useful messages, and even if the message is useful this omits the stack trace. Including a complete stack trace of the error along with the exception message in the log allows developers to better understand the context of the exception and identify the source of the error more quickly and accurately.  If the method invocation includes any call to `Exception.getMessage()` or `Exception.getLocalizedMessage()` and not an exception is already passed as the last parameter to the log method, then we will append the exception as the last parameter in the log method.

_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddColumnAnnotation_

When an attribute is annotated with `@ElementCollection`, a separate table is created for the attribute that includes the attribute  ID and value. In OpenJPA, the column for the annotated attribute is named element, whereas EclipseLink names the column based on  the name of the attribute. To remain compatible with tables that were created with OpenJPA, add a `@Column` annotation with the name  attribute set to element.

### [Unannotated collection attributes require a Transient annotation](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtocollections.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToCollections_

In OpenJPA, attributes that inherit from the `java.util.Collection&lt;E&gt;` interface are not a default persistent type, so these attributes are not persisted unless they are annotated. EclipseLink has a different default behavior and attempts to persist these attributes to the database. To keep the OpenJPA behavior of ignoring unannotated collection attributes, add the `javax.persistence.Transient` annotation to these attributes in EclipseLink.

### [Private accessor methods must have a `@Transient` annotation](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtoprivateaccessor.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToPrivateAccessor_

According to the JPA 2.1 specification, when property access is used, the property accessor methods must be public or protected. OpenJPA ignores any private accessor methods, whereas EclipseLink persists those attributes. To ignore private accessor methods in EclipseLink, the methods must have a `@Transient` annotation.

### [Remove the `@Temporal` annotation for some `java.sql` attributes](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/removetemporalannotation.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveTemporalAnnotation_

OpenJPA persists the fields of attributes of type `java.sql.Date`, `java.sql.Time`, or `java.sql.Timestamp` that have a `javax.persistence.Temporal` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception. Remove the `@Temporal` annotation so the behavior in EclipseLink will match the behavior in OpenJPA.

### [`@JoinColumn` annotations must be used with relationship mappings](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/usejoincolumnformapping.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.UseJoinColumnForMapping_

In OpenJPA, when a relationship attribute has either a `@OneToOne` or a `@ManyToOne` annotation with a `@Column` annotation, the `@Column` annotation is treated as a `@JoinColumn` annotation. EclipseLink throws an exception that indicates that the entity class must use `@JoinColumn` instead of `@Column` to map a relationship attribute.

### [Unannotated entity attributes require a Transient annotation](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/addtransientannotationtoentity.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToEntity_

In OpenJPA, attributes that are themselves entity classes are not persisted by default. EclipseLink has a different default behavior and tries to persist these attributes to the database. To keep the OpenJPA behavior of ignoring unannotated entity attributes, add the `javax.persistence.Transient` annotation to these attributes in EclipseLink.

### [`@Embeddable` classes cannot have an `@Id` annotation when referenced by an `@EmbeddedId` annotation](/recipes/java/migrate/javax/removeembeddableid.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveEmbeddableId_

According to the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, if an entity defines an attribute with an `@EmbeddedId` annotation, the embeddable class cannot contain an attribute with an `@Id` annotation. If both the `@EmbeddedId` annotation and the `@Id` annotation are defined, OpenJPA ignores the `@Id` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception.

### [Rename getter methods to fit Lombok](/recipes/java/migrate/lombok/adoptlombokgettermethodnames.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.migrate.lombok.AdoptLombokGetterMethodNames_

Rename methods that are effectively getter to the name Lombok would give them.  Limitations:  - If two methods in a class are effectively the same getter then one's name will be corrected and the others name will be left as it is.  - If the correct name for a method is already taken by another method then the name will not be corrected.  - Method name swaps or circular renaming within a class cannot be performed because the names block each other. E.g. `int getFoo() { return ba; } int getBa() { return foo; }` stays as it is.

_org.openrewrite.nodejs.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck_

This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable.

_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.DatabaseComponentAndBeanInitializationOrderingUnconditionally_

Beans of certain well-known types, such as `JdbcTemplate`, will be ordered so that they are initialized after the database has been initialized. If you have a bean that works with the `DataSource` directly, annotate its class or `@Bean` method with `@DependsOnDatabaseInitialization` to ensure that it too is initialized after the database has been initialized. See the [release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes#initialization-ordering) for more. This recipe will not check if the `@DependsOnDatabaseInitialization` annotation is on the classpath.

### [Remove unneeded `oauth2Login` config when upgrading to Spring Security 6](/recipes/java/spring/security6/removeoauth2loginconfig.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.RemoveOauth2LoginConfig_

`oauth2Login()` is a Spring Security feature that allows users to authenticate with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider. When a user is authenticated using this feature, they are granted a set of authorities that determines what actions they are allowed to perform within the application.  In Spring Security 5, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider via `oauth2Login()` is `ROLE_USER`. This means that the user is allowed to access the application's resources as a regular user.  However, in Spring Security 6, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 provider is `OAUTH2_USER`, and the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OpenID Connect 1.0 provider is `OIDC_USER`. These authorities are more specific and allow for better customization of the user's permissions within the application.  If you are upgrading to Spring Security 6 and you have previously configured a `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` to handle the authorities of users authenticated via `oauth2Login()`, you can remove it completely as the new default authorities should be sufficient.

### [Keep the default RequestCache querying behavior in Spring Security 5](/recipes/java/spring/security6/updaterequestcache.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.UpdateRequestCache_

By default, Spring Security 5 queries the saved request on every request, which means that in a typical setup, the HttpSession is queried on every request to use the RequestCache. In Spring Security 6, the default behavior has changed, and RequestCache will only be queried for a cached request if the HTTP parameter &quot;continue&quot; is defined. To maintain the same default behavior as Spring Security 5, either explicitly add the HTTP parameter &quot;continue&quot; to every request or use NullRequestCache to override the default behavior.

### [Applications using logging shutdown hooks](/recipes/java/spring/boot2/search/loggingshutdownhooks.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.LoggingShutdownHooks_

Spring Boot registers a logging shutdown hook by default for JAR-based applications to ensure that logging resources are released when the JVM exits. If your application is deployed as a WAR then the shutdown hook is not registered since the servlet container usually handles logging concerns.   Most applications will want the shutdown hook. However, if your application has complex context hierarchies, then you may need to disable it. You can use the `logging.register-shutdown-hook` property to do that.

### [Normalize Spring properties to kebab-case](/recipes/java/spring/propertiestokebabcase.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.java.spring.PropertiesToKebabCase_

Normalize Spring properties to use lowercase and hyphen-separated syntax.  For example, changing `spring.main.showBanner` to `spring.main.show-banner`.  With [Spring's relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding),  `kebab-case` may be used in properties files and still be converted to configuration beans.  Note, an exception to this is the case of `@Value`, which is match-sensitive. For example, `@Value(&quot;${anExampleValue}&quot;)` will not match `an-example-value`.  [The Spring reference documentation recommends using `kebab-case` for properties where possible](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding).

Previously, the server.max-http-header-size was treated inconsistently across the four supported embedded web servers. When using Jetty, Netty, or Undertow it would configure the max HTTP request header size. When using Tomcat it would configure the max HTTP request and response header sizes. The renamed property is used to configure the http request header size in Spring Boot 3.0. **To limit the max header size of an HTTP response on Tomcat or Jetty (the only two servers that support such a setting), use a `WebServerFactoryCustomizer`**.

_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.AddSerialVersionUidToSerializable_

A `serialVersionUID` field is strongly recommended in all `Serializable` classes. If this is not defined on a `Serializable` class, the compiler will generate this value. If a change is later made to the class, the generated value will change and attempts to deserialize the class will fail.

### [Annotate methods which may return `null` with `@Nullable`](/recipes/staticanalysis/annotatenullablemethods.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.AnnotateNullableMethods_

Add `@Nullable` to non-private methods that may return `null`. By default `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` is used, but through the `nullableAnnotationClass` option a custom annotation can be provided. When providing a custom `nullableAnnotationClass` that annotation should be meta annotated with `@Target(TYPE_USE)`. This recipe scans for methods that do not already have a `@Nullable` annotation and checks their return statements for potential null values. It also identifies known methods from standard libraries that may return null, such as methods from `Map`, `Queue`, `Deque`, `NavigableSet`, and `Spliterator`. The return of streams, or lambdas are not taken into account.

Add `@Nullable` to parameters of public methods that are explicitly checked for `null`. By default `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` is used, but through the `nullableAnnotationClass` option a custom annotation can be provided. When providing a custom `nullableAnnotationClass` that annotation should be meta annotated with `@Target(TYPE_USE)`. This recipe scans for methods that do not already have parameters annotated with `@Nullable` annotation and checks their usages for potential null checks. Additional null-checking methods can be specified via the `additionalNullCheckingMethods` option.

_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.AnnotateRequiredParameters_

Add `@NonNull` to parameters of public methods that are explicitly checked for `null` and throw an exception if null. By default `org.jspecify.annotations.NonNull` is used, but through the `nonNullAnnotationClass` option a custom annotation can be provided. When providing a custom `nonNullAnnotationClass` that annotation should be meta annotated with `@Target(TYPE_USE)`. This recipe scans for methods that do not already have parameters annotated with `@NonNull` annotation and checks for null validation patterns that throw exceptions, such as `if (param == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException()`.

### [`new BigDecimal(double)` should not be used](/recipes/staticanalysis/bigdecimaldoubleconstructorrecipe.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.BigDecimalDoubleConstructorRecipe_

Use of `new BigDecimal(double)` constructor can lead to loss of precision. Use `BigDecimal.valueOf(double)` instead. For example writing `new BigDecimal(0.1)` does not create a `BigDecimal` which is exactly equal to `0.1`, but it is equal to `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`. This is because `0.1` cannot be represented exactly as a double (or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of any finite length).

### [Modernize `BufferedWriter` creation &amp; prevent file descriptor leaks](/recipes/staticanalysis/bufferedwritercreationrecipes.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.BufferedWriterCreationRecipes_

The code `new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(f))` creates a `BufferedWriter` that does not close the underlying `FileWriter` when it is closed. This can lead to file descriptor leaks as per [CWE-755](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755.html).

_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.DeclarationSiteTypeVariance_

Currently, Java requires use-site type variance, so if someone has `Function&lt;IN, OUT&gt;` method parameter, it should rather be `Function&lt;? super IN, ? extends OUT&gt;`. Unfortunately, it is not easy to notice that `? super` and `? extends` is missing, so this recipe adds it where that would improve the situation.

Checking `indexOf` against `&gt;0` ignores the first element, whereas `&gt;-1` is inclusive of the first element. For clarity, `&gt;=1` is used, because `&gt;0` and `&gt;=1` are semantically equal. Using `&gt;0` may appear to be a mistake with the intent of including all elements. If the intent is to check whether a value in included in a `String` or `List`, the `String#contains(String)` or `List#contains(Object)` methods may be better options altogether.

_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.ReferentialEqualityToObjectEquals_

Using `==` or `!=` compares object references, not the equality of two objects. This modifies code where both sides of a binary operation (`==` or `!=`) override `Object.equals(Object obj)` except when the comparison is within an overridden `Object.equals(Object obj)` method declaration itself. The resulting transformation must be carefully reviewed since any modifications change the program's semantics.

_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.RenameLocalVariablesToCamelCase_

Reformat local variable and method parameter names to camelCase to comply with Java naming convention. The recipe will not rename variables declared in for loop controls or catches with a single character. The first character is set to lower case and existing capital letters are preserved. Special characters that are allowed in java field names `$` and `_` are removed (unless the name starts with one). If a special character is removed the next valid alphanumeric will be capitalized. Currently, does not support renaming members of classes.

_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.ReplaceCollectionToArrayArgWithEmptyArray_

Changes new array creation with `Collection#toArray(T[])` to use an empty array argument, which is better for performance.  According to the `Collection#toArray(T[])` documentation:  &gt; If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.  However, although it's not intuitive, allocating a right-sized array ahead of time to pass to the API appears to be [generally worse for performance](https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/#_conclusion) according to benchmarking and JVM developers due to a number of implementation details in both Java and the virtual machine.  H2 achieved significant performance gains by [switching to empty arrays instead pre-sized ones](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/311).

### [Use the diamond operator](/recipes/staticanalysis/usediamondoperator.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UseDiamondOperator_

The diamond operator (`&lt;&gt;`) should be used. Java 7 introduced the diamond operator to reduce the verbosity of generics code. For instance, instead of having to declare a `List`'s type in both its declaration and its constructor, you can now simplify the constructor declaration with `&lt;&gt;`, and the compiler will infer the type.

### [Replaces `Object.notify()` with `Object.notifyAll()`](/recipes/staticanalysis/useobjectnotifyall.md)
 
_org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UseObjectNotifyAll_

`Object.notifyAll()` and `Object.notify()` both wake up sleeping threads, but `Object.notify()` only rouses one while `Object.notifyAll()` rouses all of them. Since `Object.notify()` might not wake up the right thread, `Object.notifyAll()` should be used instead. See [this](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/THI02-J.+Notify+all+waiting+threads+rather+than+a+single+thread) for more information.

_tech.picnic.errorprone.refasterrules.AssertJBigDecimalRulesRecipes_

Note that, contrary to collections of Refaster rules for other `org.assertj.core.api.NumberAssert` subtypes, these rules do not rewrite to/from `BigDecimalAssert#isEqualTo(Object)` and `BigDecimalAssert#isNotEqualTo(Object)`. This is  because `BigDecimal#equals(Object)` considers not only the numeric value of compared  instances, but also their scale. As a result various seemingly straightforward transformations  would actually subtly change the assertion's semantics. [Source](https://error-prone.picnic.tech/refasterrules/AssertJBigDecimalRules).

For reasons of consistency we prefer `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions#assertThatThrownBy` over static methods for specific exception  types. Note that only the most common assertion expressions are rewritten here; covering all  cases would require the implementation of an Error Prone check instead.

### [Refaster rules that replace TestNG assertions with equivalent AssertJ assertions](/recipes/tech/picnic/errorprone/refasterrules/testngtoassertjrulesrecipes.md)
 
_tech.picnic.errorprone.refasterrules.TestNGToAssertJRulesRecipes_

Some of the classes below have TestNG `@BeforeTemplate`s that reference wildcard type  bounds (`&lt;?&gt;`), while the associated AssertJ `@AfterTemplate`s reference stricter  type bounds. This introduces the risk of producing invalid code. We do this anyway, because  TestNG's wildcard types can cause javac to infer less specific types than AssertJ requires, while  the appropriate (more specific) types _will_ be inferred properly when plugged into AssertJ's  API.   The following is an example of a TestNG statement, which would not be rewritten if it weren't  for the wildcard matching (note that the type parameters of the map on the right-hand side will  be inferred to be `&lt;Object, Object&gt;` rather than `&lt;String, Object&gt;`).   ```java  List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; myMaps = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();  assertEquals(myMaps, ImmutableList.of(ImmutableMap.of()));  ``` .

_io.quarkus.updates.core.quarkus37.UpgradeToJava17_

This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when migrating to Java 17. Specifically, for those applications that are built on Java 8, this recipe will update and add dependencies on J2EE libraries that are no longer directly bundled with the JDK. This recipe will also replace deprecated API with equivalents when there is a clear migration strategy. Build files will also be updated to use Java 17 as the target/source and plugins will be also be upgraded to versions that are compatible with Java 17.
