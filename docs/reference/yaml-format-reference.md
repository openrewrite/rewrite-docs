# Declarative YAML format

OpenRewrite allows you to create [recipes](../concepts-and-explanations/recipes.md) and [styles](../concepts-and-explanations/styles.md) in [YAML](https://yaml.org). While doing so potentially reduces customizability, it makes up for that with development speed and portability.

To help you confidently define recipes and styles in YAML, this guide will walk you through all of the ways you can configure an OpenRewrite YAML file.

:::info
Note that values passed to declarative recipes are subject to YAML interpretation. So `1.20` would be interpreted as a float, causing the trailing 0 to be dropped. Wrapping the value in single or double quotes will resolve this.
:::

## Where OpenRewrite YAML files can exist

There are two places where you can define an OpenRewrite YAML file:

1. Within the `rewrite.yml` file of a project that applies rewrite recipes via the [rewrite-gradle-plugin](gradle-plugin-configuration.md) or [rewrite-maven-plugin](rewrite-maven-plugin.md)
2. Inside the `META-INF/rewrite` folder of a JAR (such as in the [rewrite-testing-frameworks](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-testing-frameworks/tree/main/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite))

If you define a recipe or style in the `rewrite.yml` file, they _will not_ be included in the JARs published from your project.

If you want to distribute a recipe or a style and apply them to other projects, you'll need to create them inside of the `META-INF/rewrite` folder of a JAR.

## Best practices

Please keep these conventions in mind when you're creating OpenRewrite YAML files:

* A file may contain any number of recipes and styles, separated by `---`.
* Within a file, recipe and style names must be fully qualified.
* Custom recipes should not be placed into the `org.openrewrite` namespace. Instead, they should follow the same [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse\_domain\_name\_notation) used in Java packages.

### Preconditions

Preconditions are used to limit which source files a recipe is allowed to make edits to.
This is commonly used to target specific files or directories.
Technically almost any recipe can be used as a precondition, but generally it is lightweight and fast search recipes that are used for this purpose.

When a recipe is used as a precondition, any file it would make a change to is considered to meet the precondition.
When more than one recipe is used as preconditions, _all_ of them must make a change to the file for it to be considered to meet the precondition. 

:::info 
Changes made by preconditions are not included in the final result of the recipe.
Changes made by preconditions are used _only_ to determine if the recipe should edit a particular source file.
:::

#### Adding preconditions to a YAML recipe

To create these top-level preconditions, you'll need to add the `preconditions` map to your declarative recipe's YAML. This object is a list of one or more recipes (formatted the same way as the [recipeList](#recipe-list)).

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: org.openrewrite.PreconditionExample
preconditions:
  - org.openrewrite.text.Find:
      find: 1
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.text.ChangeText:
     toText: 2
```
On its own `ChangeText` would change the contents of all text files in the project to `2`.
But because `Find` is used as a precondition, `ChangeText` will only be run on files that contain a `1`.

**Recipes commonly used as preconditions include:**

* `org.openrewrite.FindSourceFiles` - limits the recipe to only run on files whose path matches a glob pattern
* `org.openrewrite.text.Find` - limits the recipe to only run on files that contain a given string
* `org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes` - limits the recipe to run only on source code which contain a given type
* `org.openrewrite.java.search.HasJavaVersion` - limits the recipe to run only on Java source code with the specified source or target compatibility versions. Allowing a recipe to be targeted only at Java 8, 11, 17, etc., code.
* `org.openrewrite.java.search.IsLikelyTest` - limits the recipe to run only on source code which is likely to be test code.
* `org.openrewrite.java.search.IsLikelyNotTest` - limits the recipe to run only on source code which is likely to be production code.

#### Creating "OR" preconditions instead of "AND"

As mentioned above, _every_ recipe in the `preconditions` section is run and must apply to a file for it to "meet the precondition". However, what if you wanted to write a recipe where you had many precondition recipes â€“ but you wanted to check if _any_ of them pass rather than _all_ of them?

To do this, you'll want to create a recipe that wraps all of your preconditions up into one recipe, and then use that recipe as the precondition such as in the following example:

```yaml
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: org.sample.DoSomething
displayName: Do Something
preconditions:
  - org.sample.FindAnyJson
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.json.ChangeKey:
      oldKeyPath: $.foo
      newKey: bar
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: org.sample.FindAnyJson
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.FindSourceFiles:
      filePattern: "**/my.json"
  - org.openrewrite.FindSourceFiles:
      filePattern: "**/your.json"
  - org.openrewrite.FindSourceFiles:
      filePattern: "**/our.json"
```

In this example, if a file matches `**/my.json` OR `**/your.json*` OR `**/our.json`, then the precondition has passed and the `ChangeKey` recipe will be applied to it.

#### Precondition scope

A common mistake new users make is to assume that if a precondition matches any file, then the recipe will apply to the entire repository.

For example, you might be tempted to use `FindPlugins` as a precondition for `CommonStaticAnalysis` with the idea that you only want static analysis fixes on Gradle projects that apply a specific plugin. 

However, if you were to do this, you wouldn't get the results you expected as the `FindPlugins` recipe flags the plugin in `build.gradle` files. In other words, the `CommonStaticAnalysis` recipe would only be run against those `build.gradle` files.

Fortunately, there are recipes that _can_ be used in this type of situation. For instance, the `ModuleHasPlugin` recipe will mark _all_ files within a project if a specific plugin is found:

```yaml
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: org.sample.FixedSonarStaticAnalysis
displayName: Fix sonar issues 
description: >- 
  This recipe applies common static analysis issues only to gradle projects that apply the sonar plugin. 
  This works because ModuleHasPlugin will mark all files within a project that applies the plugin.
preconditions:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.search.ModuleHasPlugin:
      pluginId: org.sonarqube
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CommonStaticAnalysis
```

It isn't obvious from just the names of the recipes that `FindPlugins` and `ModuleHasPlugin` behave differently. Because of that, the best way for you to know whether a particular recipe is suitable as a precondition or not is to run that recipe on its own.

If the recipe adds search markers or edits to every individual source file you want changes made to, it is suitable as a precondition. If not, then you'll need to find another recipe.

:::warning
Before OpenRewrite 8.52.0 `ScanningRecipe`s were not supported as YAML preconditions.

If you encounter errors attempting to use recipes like `ModuleHasPlugin` as preconditions ensure you are using a recent version of OpenRewrite.
:::

### Recipe list

A declarative recipe can be made up of one or more recipes. The recipes in the list could be other declarative recipes defined in the same file or they can be imperative recipes created elsewhere. Like imperative recipes, each recipe in this list can potentially have configuration options that need to be specified.

:::tip
Recipes in the `recipeList` will run in the order they are listed. That being said, a declarative recipe may include another declarative recipe declared later in the same `rewrite.yml` file.
:::

### Recipe example

Consider this example declarative recipe:

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.RecipeA
displayName: Recipe A
description: Applies Recipe B.
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
estimatedEffortPerOccurrence: PT15M
causesAnotherCycle: true
recipeList:
  - com.yourorg.RecipeB:
      exampleConfig1: foo
      exampleConfig2: bar
  - com.yourorg.RecipeC
```

If you wanted to run this recipe (but not distribute it to others), you would:

1. Copy the above YAML into a `rewrite.yml` file at the root of your project
2. Configure the [Gradle plugin](gradle-plugin-configuration.md) or [Maven plugin](rewrite-maven-plugin.md) to have an active recipe of `com.yourorg.RecipeA`
3. Run the `mvn rewrite:run` or the `gradle rewriteRun` command

## Styles

### Format

:::info
You can find the full style schema [here](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/241e146a8996a917a8a460b27d17136108b3d50a/rewrite-core/openrewrite.json#L126-L153).
:::

| Key          | Type             | Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type         | const            | A constant: `specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/style`                  |
| name         | string           | A fully qualified, unique name for this style                     |
| displayName  | string           | A human-readable name for this style (does not end with a period) |
| description  | string           | A human-readable description for this style (ends with a period)  |
| tags         | array of strings | A list of strings that help categorize this style                 |
| styleConfigs | array of styles  | The list of styles which comprise this style                      |

### Style example

Consider this example declarative style, which specifies that tabs should be used for indentation and that at least 9999 imports from a given package should be required before collapsing them into a single star import:

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/style
name: com.yourorg.YesTabsNoStarImports
styleConfigs:
  - org.openrewrite.java.style.TabsAndIndentsStyle:
      useTabCharacter: true
  - org.openrewrite.java.style.ImportLayoutStyle:
      classCountToUseStarImport: 9999
```

To put this style in effect for any formatting performed by OpenRewrite within the current project:

1. Put the above into a `rewrite.yml` file at the project root
2. Configure the [gradle plugin](gradle-plugin-configuration.md) or [maven plugin](rewrite-maven-plugin.md) with `com.yourorg.YesTabsNoStarImports` listed as the active style

The next time any OpenRewrite recipe is run in that project, any formatting it performs will take these styles into account.
