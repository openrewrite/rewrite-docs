# JsonPath and JsonPathMatcher reference

:::info
Despite the name, `JsonPathMatcher` and `JsonPath` expressions may be used in other markup languages besides JSON that support it, such as YAML. When we refer to "JSON" keep in mind that `JsonPathMatcher` and `JsonPath` expressions apply to markup languages that have a `JsonPathMatcher` implementation, such as YAML.
:::

`JsonPathMatcher` provides methods for matching the given cursor location using a provided `JsonPath` expression. "JsonPath" (sometimes stylized as JSONPath) is a query language for JSON, similar to how XPath is a query language for XML. Despite the name, JsonPathMatcher can be used in other languages besides JSON, such as YAML.

`JsonPathMatcher` and `JsonPath` expressions go hand-in-hand. A `JsonPath` expression specifies a path to an element in the JSON or YAML structure. A `JsonPathMatcher` provides methods that visitors can use to make decisions about whether an LST element is a desired target.

## JsonPath expression notation

A JsonPath expression specifies a path to an element, or set of elements, in a JSON-like structure.

:::warning
The JsonPath expression syntax OpenRewrite provides is a subset implementation of the JsonPath syntax.
:::

### Syntax components

Paths can use dot notation or bracket notation. For example, these two JsonPath expressions are equivalent:

```text
$.spec.containers[0].image
$['spec']['containers'][0]['image']
```

Additional syntax subcomponents of a JsonPath expression are shown below:

| Expression | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `$` | The root object of the document. |
| `.property` | Selects a specific property name. |
| `['property']` | Selects a specific property name. Use this notation if the property name contains special characters such as spaces, or begins with a character other than `A..Za..z_`. |
| `[n]` | Selects the n-th element from an array. Indexes are 0-based. |
| `[:n]` | Selects the first n elements of the array. Returns a list. |
| `..property` | Recursive descent. This searches for the specified property name recursively and returns an array of all values with this property name. Always returns a list, even if just one property is found. |
| `*` | Wildcard selects all elements in an object or an array, regardless of their names or indexes. For example, `address.*` means all properties of the `address` object, and `book[*]` means all items of the `book` array. |
| `[(expression)]` | Script expressions can be used instead of explicit property names or indexes. |
| `@` | Used in filter expressions to refer to the current node being processed. |

### Filter expressions

Filters are logical expressions used to filter arrays. An example of a JsonPath expression with a filter is:

```text
$.subjects[?(@.kind == 'ServiceAccount')].kind
```

where `[?(@.kind == 'ServiceAccount')]` is the actual filter expression, and `@` represents the current item being processed.

The supported operators of a filter expression are shown below:

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `==` | Equals to. String values should be enclosed in single quotes. For example, `[?(@.kind == 'Deployment')]`. |
| `=~` | Matches a [JavaScript regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions). For example, `[?(@.uses =~ 'actions/setup-java@v2.*')]` matches items which `uses` starts with `actions/setup-java@v2`, and so would include `actions/setup-java@v2.1.1`. |

## Configuring recipes using JsonPath expressions
Recipes that take JsonPath expressions as arguments take them as strings. In YAML, that looks like this:

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeValueExample
displayName: ChangeValueExample
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.yaml.ChangeValue:
      oldKeyPath: $.subjects[?(@.kind == 'ServiceAccount')].kind
      value: Deployment
```

Constructing a similarly configured instance of the same recipe in Java:

```java
ChangeValue v = new ChangeValue("$.subjects[?(@.kind == 'ServiceAccount')].kind", "Deployment", null);
```

Which, for example, would change the following YAML document:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="before" label="Before">
```yml title="example.yml"
---
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: some-user
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: monitoring-tools
```

	</TabItem>

	<TabItem value="after" label="After">
```yml title="example.yml"
---
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: some-user
  - kind: Deployment
    name: monitoring-tools
```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Authoring recipes with JsonPathMatcher

`org.openrewrite.json.JsonPathMatcher` (or `org.openrewrite.yaml.JsonPathMatcher`) are the classes that most recipes will use JsonPath expression patterns with. Instances are created by providing the JsonPath expression pattern to the JsonPathMatcher constructor:

```java
JsonPathMatcher matcher = new JsonPathMatcher("$.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'app')].image");
```

Once you have constructed your JsonPathMatcher with a JsonPath expression as the "evaluation target", you can use the JsonPathMatcher to determine whether a given `Cursor` at a point within the tree matches what you're looking for as demonstrated by the [following example from rewrite-json](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/769f6de46e2e3d711c495feb82e7e5e0f2d889c9/rewrite-json/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/json/ChangeValue.java#L57-L76):

```java
@Override
public TreeVisitor<?, ExecutionContext> getVisitor() {
    JsonPathMatcher matcher = new JsonPathMatcher(oldKeyPath);
    return new JsonIsoVisitor<ExecutionContext>() {
        @Override
        public Json.Member visitMember(Json.Member member, ExecutionContext ctx) {
            Json.Member m = super.visitMember(member, ctx);
            if (matcher.matches(getCursor()) && (!(m.getValue() instanceof Json.Literal) || !((Json.Literal) m.getValue()).getValue().equals(value))) {
                String source = ChangeValue.this.value;
                if (source.startsWith("'") || source.startsWith("\"")) {
                    source = source.substring(1, source.length() - 1);
                }
                if (!(m.getValue() instanceof Json.Literal) || !((Json.Literal) m.getValue()).getSource().equals(ChangeValue.this.value)) {
                    m = m.withValue(new Json.Literal(randomId(), m.getValue().getPrefix(), Markers.EMPTY, ChangeValue.this.value, source));
                }
            }
            return m;
        }
    };
}
```
