# Post quantum cryptography

**io.moderne.cryptography.PostQuantumCryptography**

_This recipe searches for instances in code that may be impacted by post quantum cryptography. Applications may need to support larger key sizes, different algorithms, or use crypto agility to handle the migration. The recipe includes detection of hardcoded values that affect behavior in a post-quantum world, programmatic configuration that may prevent algorithm changes, and general cryptographic usage patterns that should be reviewed._

## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `io.moderne.recipe:rewrite-cryptography` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed):
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("io.moderne.cryptography.PostQuantumCryptography")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("io.moderne.recipe:rewrite-cryptography:{{VERSION_IO_MODERNE_RECIPE_REWRITE_CRYPTOGRAPHY}}")
}
```

2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle-init-script" label="Gradle init script">

1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.

```groovy title="init.gradle"
initscript {

    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("io.moderne.recipe:rewrite-cryptography:{{VERSION_IO_MODERNE_RECIPE_REWRITE_CRYPTOGRAPHY}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("io.moderne.cryptography.PostQuantumCryptography")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
