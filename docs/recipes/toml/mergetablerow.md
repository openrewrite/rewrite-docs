# Merge TOML table row

**org.openrewrite.toml.MergeTableRow**

_Merge a TOML row into an array table. If a row with the same identifying property exists, merge the values. Otherwise, insert a new row._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | tableName | The name of the TOML array table to merge into (e.g., 'package.contributors'). | `package.contributors` |
| `String` | row | The TOML key-value pairs to merge. Should contain the objectIdentifyingProperty. | `name = "Alice Smith"\nemail = "alice@example.com"` |
| `String` | identifyingKey | The property name used to match existing rows. When a row with this property value exists, it will be merged; otherwise, a new row is inserted. When the original row has more properties than the incoming row, these original properties are preserved. Entries with null values in the incoming row will result in the removal of the property from the original row. | `name` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.MergeTableRowExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.MergeTableRowExample
displayName: Merge TOML table row example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.toml.MergeTableRow:
      tableName: package.contributors
      row: name = "Alice Smith"\nemail = "alice@example.com"
      identifyingKey: name
```

Now that `com.yourorg.MergeTableRowExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.MergeTableRowExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe MergeTableRow --recipe-option "tableName=package.contributors" --recipe-option "row=name = "Alice Smith"\nemail = "alice@example.com"" --recipe-option "identifyingKey=name"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-toml:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_TOML}}
```
