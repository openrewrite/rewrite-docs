| `String` | oldArtifactId | The old artifactId to replace. The artifactId is the second part of a plugin coordinate 'com.google.guava:guava:VERSION'. Supports glob expressions. | `my-deprecated-annotation-processor` |
| `String` | newGroupId | *Optional*. The new groupId to use. Defaults to the existing group id. | `corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe` |
| `String` | newArtifactId | *Optional*. The new artifactId to use. Defaults to the existing artifact id. | `my-new-annotation-processor` |
| `String` | newVersion | *Optional*. An version string for the annotation processor path. Version strings that start with 'micronaut.' will be treated specially.  | `micronaut.validation` |
| `List` | exclusions | *Optional*. A list of exclusions to apply to the annotation processor path in the format groupId:artifactId | `io.micronaut:micronaut-inject` |


## Used by

This recipe is used as part of the following composite recipes:

* [Update the version of core annotation processors](/recipes/java/micronaut/updatemavenannotationprocessors.md)


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeAnnotationProcessorPathExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeAnnotationProcessorPathExample
displayName: Change Maven annotation processor path example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.ChangeAnnotationProcessorPath:
      oldGroupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
      oldArtifactId: my-deprecated-annotation-processor
      newGroupId: corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe
      newArtifactId: my-new-annotation-processor
      newVersion: micronaut.validation
      exclusions: io.micronaut:micronaut-inject
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeAnnotationProcessorPathExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-micronaut:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MICRONAUT}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangeAnnotationProcessorPathExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-micronaut:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MICRONAUT}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"

          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangeAnnotationProcessorPath --recipe-option "oldGroupId=org.openrewrite.recipe" --recipe-option "oldArtifactId=my-deprecated-annotation-processor" --recipe-option "newGroupId=corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe" --recipe-option "newArtifactId=my-new-annotation-processor" --recipe-option "newVersion=micronaut.validation" --recipe-option "exclusions=io.micronaut:micronaut-inject"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-micronaut:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MICRONAUT}}
```
