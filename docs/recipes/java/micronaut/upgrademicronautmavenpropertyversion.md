    </properties>
</project>
```


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradeMicronautMavenPropertyVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradeMicronautMavenPropertyVersionExample
displayName: Upgrade `micronaut.version` Maven property example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.micronaut.UpgradeMicronautMavenPropertyVersion:
      newVersion: 4.x
```

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradeMicronautMavenPropertyVersionExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-micronaut:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MICRONAUT}}` in your build file:

<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.UpgradeMicronautMavenPropertyVersionExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-micronaut:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MICRONAUT}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
