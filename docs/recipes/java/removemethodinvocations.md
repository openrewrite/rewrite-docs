# Remove method invocations

**org.openrewrite.java.RemoveMethodInvocations**

_Remove method invocations if syntactically safe._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-java/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/RemoveMethodInvocations.java), 
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues),

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | methodPattern | A pattern to match method invocations for removal. A [[method pattern](/reference/method-patterns)](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/method-patterns) is used to find matching method invocations. For example, to find all method invocations in the Guava library, use the pattern: `com.google.common..*#*(..)`.<br/><br/>The pattern format is `<PACKAGE>#<METHOD_NAME>(<ARGS>)`. <br/><br/>`..*` includes all subpackages of `com.google.common`. <br/>`*(..)` matches any method name with any number of arguments. <br/><br/>For more specific queries, like Guava's `ImmutableMap`, use `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap#*(..)` to narrow down the results. | `java.lang.StringBuilder append(java.lang.String)` |

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.RemoveMethodInvocationsExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.RemoveMethodInvocationsExample
displayName: Remove method invocations example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.RemoveMethodInvocations:
      methodPattern: java.lang.StringBuilder append(java.lang.String)
```

Now that `com.yourorg.RemoveMethodInvocationsExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.RemoveMethodInvocationsExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.RemoveMethodInvocationsExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe RemoveMethodInvocations --recipe-option "methodPattern=java.lang.StringBuilder append(java.lang.String)"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-java:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_JAVA}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

| Source path after the run | A recipe may modify the source path. This is the path after the run. `null` when a source file was deleted during the run. |
| Parent of the recipe that made changes | In a hierarchical recipe, the parent of the recipe that made a change. Empty if this is the root of a hierarchy or if the recipe is not hierarchical at all. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
