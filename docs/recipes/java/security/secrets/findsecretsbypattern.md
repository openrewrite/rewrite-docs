## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/secrets/FindSecretsByPattern.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-java-security/2.13.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
* artifactId: rewrite-java-security
* version: 2.13.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | secretName | The type of secret that this recipe is looking for. | `AWS Access Key` |
| `String` | keyPattern | *Optional*. A regular expression to match a 'key' against. For example, a key  | `[a-zA-Z0-9+\/=]{88}` |
| `String` | valuePattern | A regular expression to search for. | `[a-zA-Z0-9+\/=]{88}` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindSecretsByPatternExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.FindSecretsByPatternExample
displayName: Find secrets with regular expressions example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.security.secrets.FindSecretsByPattern:
      secretName: AWS Access Key
      keyPattern: '[a-zA-Z0-9+\/=]{88}'
      valuePattern: '[a-zA-Z0-9+\/=]{88}'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.FindSecretsByPatternExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-security:2.13.0 in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.24.0")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.FindSecretsByPatternExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-security:2.13.0")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
