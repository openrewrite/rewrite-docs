# Make implausibly long `@Timeout` values explicit in minutes

**org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.ImplausibleTimeoutToMinutes**

_JUnit Jupiter's `@Timeout` defaults to `TimeUnit.SECONDS`, so a value such as `@Timeout(10000)` is interpreted as almost three hours, which is most likely a mistake where milliseconds were intended. This recipe rewrites such implausibly large second-based timeouts to the equivalent number of minutes, for instance `@Timeout(value = 167, unit = TimeUnit.MINUTES)`, preserving the original (likely erroneous) semantics while making the mistake far more visible for review._
