# Use latest JAXB API and runtime for Jakarta EE 8

**org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddJaxbRuntime**

_Update build files to use the latest JAXB runtime from Jakarta EE 8 to maintain compatibility with Java version 11 or greater. The recipe will add a JAXB run-time, in Gradle `compileOnly`+`testImplementation` and Maven `provided` scope, to any project that has a transitive dependency on the JAXB API. **The resulting dependencies still use the `javax` namespace, despite the move to the Jakarta artifact**._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | runtime | Which implementation of the JAXB run-time that will be added to maven projects that have transitive dependencies on the JAXB API Valid options: `glassfish`, `sun` | `glassfish` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddJaxbRuntimeExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddJaxbRuntimeExample
displayName: Use latest JAXB API and runtime for Jakarta EE 8 example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddJaxbRuntime:
      runtime: glassfish
```

Now that `com.yourorg.AddJaxbRuntimeExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MIGRATE_JAVA}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.AddJaxbRuntimeExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MIGRATE_JAVA}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe AddJaxbRuntime --recipe-option "runtime=glassfish"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_MIGRATE_JAVA}}
```
