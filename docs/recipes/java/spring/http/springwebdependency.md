## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed):
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.http.SpringWebDependency")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}")
}
```

2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle-init-script" label="Gradle init script">

1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.

```groovy title="init.gradle"
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.spring.http.SpringWebDependency")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run the recipe.

```shell title="shell"
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```

</TabItem>

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.
