# Add `@Configuration` to classes with `@EnableXXXSecurity` annotations

**org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurity**

_Prior to Spring Security 6, `@EnableXXXSecurity` implicitly had `@Configuration`. `Configuration` was removed from the definitions of the `@EnableSecurity` definitions in Spring Security 6. Consequently classes annotated with `@EnableXXXSecurity` coming from pre-Boot 3 should have `@Configuration` annotation added._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/spring/boot3/ConfigurationOverEnableSecurity.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-spring/5.20.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
* artifactId: rewrite-spring
* version: 5.20.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `boolean` | forceAddConfiguration | Force add `@Configuration` regardless current Boot version. | `true` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurityExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurityExample
displayName: Add `@Configuration` to classes with `@EnableXXXSecurity` annotations example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurity:
      forceAddConfiguration: false
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurityExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:5.20.0 in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.24.0")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurityExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:5.20.0")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>

        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ConfigurationOverEnableSecurityExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-spring</artifactId>
            <version>5.20.0</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ConfigurationOverEnableSecurityExample
```
</TabItem>
