# Migrate `Filter` to `OncePerRequestFilter`

**io.moderne.java.spring.framework.MigrateFilterToOncePerRequestFilter**

_Migrates classes that implement `javax.servlet.Filter` (or `jakarta.servlet.Filter`) to extend `org.springframework.web.filter.OncePerRequestFilter`. This transformation renames `doFilter` to `doFilterInternal`, changes parameter types to HTTP variants, removes manual casting, and removes empty `init()` and `destroy()` methods._
