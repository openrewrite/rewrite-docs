This recipe is available under the [Moderne Source Available License](https://docs.moderne.io/licensing/moderne-source-available-license).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | oldPropertyKey | The property key to rename. | `management.metrics.binders.*.enabled` |
| `String` | newPropertyKey | The new name for the property key. | `management.metrics.enable.process.files` |
| `List` | except | *Optional*. Regex. If any of these property keys exist as direct children of `oldPropertyKey`, then they will not be moved to `newPropertyKey`. | `jvm` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeSpringPropertyKeyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeSpringPropertyKeyExample
displayName: Change the key of a spring application property example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.spring.ChangeSpringPropertyKey:
      oldPropertyKey: management.metrics.binders.*.enabled
      newPropertyKey: management.metrics.enable.process.files
      except: jvm
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeSpringPropertyKeyExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangeSpringPropertyKeyExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangeSpringPropertyKey --recipe-option "oldPropertyKey=management.metrics.binders.*.enabled" --recipe-option "newPropertyKey=management.metrics.enable.process.files" --recipe-option "except=jvm"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}
```
