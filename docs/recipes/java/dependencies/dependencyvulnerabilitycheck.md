# Find and fix vulnerable dependencies

**org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-dependencies/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/dependencies/DependencyVulnerabilityCheck.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-dependencies/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-java-dependencies/)

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | scope | *Optional*. Match dependencies with the specified scope. Default is `compile`. Valid options: `compile`, `test`, `runtime`, `provided` | `compile` |
| `Boolean` | overrideTransitive | *Optional*. When enabled transitive dependencies with vulnerabilities will have their versions overridden. By default only direct dependencies have their version numbers upgraded. | `false` |


## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed): 
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}")
}
```

2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle-init-script" label="Gradle init script">

1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.

```groovy title="init.gradle"
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run the recipe.

```shell title="shell"
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven POM">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-java-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="maven-command-line" label="Maven Command Line">
You will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:RELEASE -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck -Drewrite.exportDatatables=true
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe DependencyVulnerabilityCheck
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
