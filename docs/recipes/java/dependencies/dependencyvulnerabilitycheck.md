# Find and fix vulnerable dependencies

**org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Upgrades dependencies versioned according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Last updated: 2025-09-22T1103._

## Recipe source

This recipe is only available to users of [Moderne](https://docs.moderne.io/).


This recipe is available under the [Moderne Proprietary License](https://docs.moderne.io/licensing/overview).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | scope | *Optional*. Match dependencies with the specified scope. Default is `runtime`. An explanation of what each scope means can be found in the [Apache Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Scope). Valid options: `compile`, `test`, `runtime`, `provided` | `runtime` |
| `Boolean` | overrideTransitive | *Optional*. When enabled transitive dependencies with vulnerabilities will have their versions overridden. By default only direct dependencies have their version numbers upgraded. | `false` |
| `UpgradeDelta` | maximumUpgradeDelta | *Optional*. The maximum difference to allow when suggesting a dependency version upgrade. Patch version upgrades are the default and safest option, as patch releases assert full backwards compatibility with no breaking changes. Minor version upgrades can introduce new features but do not _typically_ include breaking changes. Major version upgrades will typically require code changes above and beyond this recipe.  Valid options: `patch`, `minor`, `major` | `patch` |
