_Emits a data table detailing all Gradle and Maven dependencies.This recipe makes no changes to any source file._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-dependencies/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/dependencies/DependencyList.java),

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `Scope` | scope | The scope of the dependencies to include in the report. Valid options: `Compile`, `Runtime`, `TestRuntime` | `Compile` |
| `boolean` | includeTransitive | Whether or not to include transitive dependencies in the report. Defaults to including only direct dependencies. | `true` |
| `boolean` | validateResolvable | When enabled the recipe will attempt to download every dependency it encounters, reporting on any failures. This can be useful for identifying dependencies that have become unavailable since an LST was produced. Valid options: `true`, `false` | `true` |

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.DependencyListExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.DependencyListExample
displayName: Dependency report example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyList:
      scope: Compile
      includeTransitive: false
      validateResolvable: false
```

Now that `com.yourorg.DependencyListExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.DependencyListExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.DependencyListExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-java-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe DependencyList --recipe-option "scope=Compile" --recipe-option "includeTransitive=false" --recipe-option "validateResolvable=false"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
