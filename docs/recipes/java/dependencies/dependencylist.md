## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `Scope` | scope | *Optional*. The scope of the dependencies to include in the report.Defaults to "Compile" Valid options: `Compile`, `Runtime`, `TestRuntime` | `Compile` |
| `boolean` | includeTransitive | *Optional*. Whether or not to include transitive dependencies in the report. Defaults to including only direct dependencies.Defaults to false. | `true` |
| `boolean` | validateResolvable | *Optional*. When enabled the recipe will attempt to download every dependency it encounters, reporting on any failures. This can be useful for identifying dependencies that have become unavailable since an LST was produced.Defaults to false. Valid options: `true`, `false` | `true` |


## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed):
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyList")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}")
}
```

2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle-init-script" label="Gradle init script">

1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.

```groovy title="init.gradle"
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JAVA_DEPENDENCIES}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyList")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run the recipe.

```shell title="shell"
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven POM">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
