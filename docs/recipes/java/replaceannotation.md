# Replace annotation

**org.openrewrite.java.ReplaceAnnotation**

_Replace an Annotation with another one if the annotation pattern matches. Only fixed parameters can be set in the replacement._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-java/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/ReplaceAnnotation.java), 
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), 
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-java/)
## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | annotationPatternToReplace | An annotation matcher, expressed as a [method pattern](/reference/method-patterns) to replace. | `@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull("Test")` |
| `String` | annotationTemplateToInsert | An annotation template to add instead of original one, will be parsed with `JavaTemplate`. | `@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull("Null not permitted")` |
| `String` | classpathResourceName | *Optional*. If the annotation's type is defined by a jar within the META-INF/rewrite/classpath directory provide its name here so that it can be loaded. When this parameter is not passed the runtime classpath of the recipe is provided to the parser producing the new annotation. This is necessary when the annotation is not on the runtime classpath of the recipe and isn't in the Java standard library. | `annotations` |

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ReplaceAnnotationExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ReplaceAnnotationExample
displayName: Replace annotation example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.ReplaceAnnotation:      annotationPatternToReplace: '@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull("Test")'
      annotationTemplateToInsert: '@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull("Null not permitted")'
      classpathResourceName: annotations
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ReplaceAnnotationExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ReplaceAnnotationExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ReplaceAnnotationExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ReplaceAnnotation --recipe-option "annotationPatternToReplace='@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull("Test")'" --recipe-option "annotationTemplateToInsert='@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull("Null not permitted")'" --recipe-option "classpathResourceName=annotations"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-java:{{VERSION_REWRITE_JAVA}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
