# Lint source code with ESLint

**org.openrewrite.codemods.ESLint**

_Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) across the code to fix common static analysis issues in the code.  This requires the code to have an existing ESLint configuration._

## Recipe source

This recipe is only available to users of [Moderne](https://docs.moderne.io/).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `List` | patterns | *Optional*. The lint target files. This can contain any of file paths, directory paths, and glob patterns. | `lib/**/*.js` |
| `String` | parser | *Optional*. Parser used by ESLint to parse the source files. Defaults to `@typescript-eslint/parser`. See [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/parsers) for more details. | `esprima` |
| `List` | parserOptions | *Optional*. A list of parser options for ESLint. The format is `key: value`. Defaults to `ecmaVersion: "latest", ecmaFeatures: { jsx: true }, sourceType: "module"`. See [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/language-options#specifying-parser-options) for more details. | `ecmaVersion: 6, ecmaFeatures: { jsx: true }` |
| `Boolean` | allowInlineConfig | *Optional*. Whether inline config comments are allowed. Defaults to `false`. See [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#disabling-inline-comments) for more details. | `true` |
| `List` | envs | *Optional*. A list of `env` mappings for ESLint. The format is `key: value`. | `browser: true` |
| `List` | globals | *Optional*. Define global variables for rules that require knowledge of these. | `var1, var2: writable` |
| `List` | plugins | *Optional*. A list of plugins for ESLint. | `@typescript-eslint, prettier` |
| `List` | extend | *Optional*. A list of extends for ESLint. | `eslint:recommended, prettier` |
| `List` | rules | *Optional*. List of rules to be checked by ESLint. Optionally, the severity and other rule options can also be specified as e.g. `off`, `warn` or `["error", "always"]`. The severity `off` is useful when the rule is declared by an extended [shareable config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/ways-to-extend#shareable-configs). For more information, see the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules) | `eqeqeq: warn, multiline-comment-style: ["error", "starred-block"], prettier/prettier` |
| `Boolean` | fix | *Optional*. Automatically fix violations when possible. Defaults to `true`. | `false` |
                    | `String` | configFile | *Optional*. Allows specifying the full ESLint configuration file contents as multiline JSON. See [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) for more details.

Note that this will override any other configuration options. | `{}` |
