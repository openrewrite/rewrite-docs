# React i18next internationalization

**org.openrewrite.codemods.ReactI18Next**

_Automatically internationalizes React applications by extracting hardcoded strings and replacing them with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com) translation calls. Handles JSX text, attributes, and template literals with variables. Creates and updates a translation JSON file with extracted strings._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | translationFilePath | *Optional*. Path to the translation JSON file where extracted strings will be stored. Defaults to `translations.json` in the root of the project. | `./src/locales/en.json` |
| `String` | importName | The package name to import translation functions from. Required. | `react-i18next` |
| `String` | translationRoot | *Optional*. Root key in the translation file to organize translations under. Defaults to `common`. | `common` |
| `String` | filePattern | *Optional*. Glob pattern to specify which files to transform. Defaults to all files. | `src/**/*.tsx` |
| `String` | parser | *Optional*. Parser to use for transforming files. Defaults to auto-detection based on file extensions (`tsx`/`ts`/`babel`). | `tsx` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ReactI18NextExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ReactI18NextExample
displayName: React i18next internationalization example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.codemods.ReactI18Next:
      translationFilePath: ./src/locales/en.json
      importName: react-i18next
      translationRoot: common
      filePattern: src/**/*.tsx
      parser: tsx
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ReactI18NextExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-codemods:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_CODEMODS}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ReactI18NextExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-codemods:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_CODEMODS}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>

          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ReactI18NextExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>

          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ReactI18Next --recipe-option "translationFilePath=./src/locales/en.json" --recipe-option "importName=react-i18next" --recipe-option "translationRoot=common" --recipe-option "filePattern=src/**/*.tsx" --recipe-option "parser=tsx"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-codemods:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_CODEMODS}}
```
