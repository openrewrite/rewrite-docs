# Use lambda expressions instead of anonymous classes

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UseLambdaForFunctionalInterface**

_Instead of anonymous class declarations, use a lambda where possible. Using lambdas to replace anonymous classes can lead to more expressive and maintainable code, improve code readability, reduce code duplication, and achieve better performance in some cases._

## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed):
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UseLambdaForFunctionalInterface")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_STATIC_ANALYSIS}}")
}
```

2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle-init-script" label="Gradle init script">

1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.

```groovy title="init.gradle"
initscript {
    repositories {

    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_STATIC_ANALYSIS}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UseLambdaForFunctionalInterface")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
