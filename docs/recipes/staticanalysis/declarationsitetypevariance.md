# Properly use declaration-site type variance

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.DeclarationSiteTypeVariance**

_Currently, Java requires use-site type variance, so if someone has `Function<IN, OUT>` method parameter, it should rather be `Function<? super IN, ? extends OUT>`. Unfortunately, it is not easy to notice that `? super` and `? extends` is missing, so this recipe adds it where that would improve the situation._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `List` | variantTypes | A list of well-known classes that have in/out type variance. | `java.util.function.Function<IN, OUT>` |
| `List` | excludedBounds | *Optional*. A list of bounds that should not receive explicit variance. Globs supported. | `java.lang.*` |
| `Boolean` | excludeFinalClasses | *Optional*. If true, do not add `? extends` variance to final classes. `? super` variance will be added regardless of finality. |  |

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.DeclarationSiteTypeVarianceExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.DeclarationSiteTypeVarianceExample
displayName: Properly use declaration-site type variance example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.DeclarationSiteTypeVariance:
      variantTypes: java.util.function.Function<IN, OUT>
      excludedBounds: java.lang.*
```

Now that `com.yourorg.DeclarationSiteTypeVarianceExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_STATIC_ANALYSIS}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.DeclarationSiteTypeVarianceExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_STATIC_ANALYSIS}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe DeclarationSiteTypeVariance --recipe-option "variantTypes=java.util.function.Function<IN, OUT>" --recipe-option "excludedBounds=java.lang.*"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-static-analysis:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_STATIC_ANALYSIS}}
