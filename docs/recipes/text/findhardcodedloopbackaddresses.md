# Find hard-coded loopback IPv4 addresses

**org.openrewrite.text.FindHardcodedLoopbackAddresses**

_Locates mentions of hard-coded IPv4 addresses from the loopback IP range. The loopback IP range includes `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`. This detects the entire localhost/loopback subnet range, not just the commonly used `127.0.0.1`._
