# Remove hard-coded IP addresses from comments

**org.openrewrite.text.RemoveHardcodedIPAddressesFromComments**

_Removes hard-coded IPv4 addresses from comments when they match private IP ranges or loopback addresses. This targets IP addresses that are commented out in various comment formats:  **Private IP ranges:**  * `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`  * `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`  * `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`  **Loopback IP range:**  * `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`  **Supported comment formats:**  * C-style line comments (`//`)  * C-style block comments (`/* */`)  * Shell/Python style comments (`#`)  * XML comments (`<!-- -->`)  * YAML comments (`#`)  * Properties file comments (`#` or `!`)  For line comments, the entire line is removed. For block comments, only the IP address is removed._
