_Search for text, treating all textual sources as plain text. This version of the recipe exists to experiment with multiselect recipe options._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | find | The text to find. This snippet can be multiline. | `blacklist` |
| `Boolean` | regex | *Optional*. If true, `find` will be interpreted as a Regular Expression. Default `false`. |  |
| `Set` | regexOptions | *Optional*. Regex processing options. Multiple options may be specified. These options do nothing if `regex` mode is not enabled.<br />* Case-sensitive - The search will be sensitive to letter case. * Multiline - Allows `^` and `$` to match the beginning and end of lines, respectively.* Dot all - Allows `.` to match line terminators. Valid options: `Case-sensitive`, `Multiline`, `Dot all` |  |
| `String` | filePattern | *Optional*. A glob expression that can be used to constrain which directories or source files should be searched. Multiple patterns may be specified, separated by a semicolon `;`. If multiple patterns are supplied any of the patterns matching will be interpreted as a match. When not set, all source files are searched.  | `**/*.java` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindMultiselectExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.FindMultiselectExample
displayName: Experimental find text with multiselect example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.text.FindMultiselect:
      find: blacklist
      filePattern: '**/*.java'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.FindMultiselectExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.FindMultiselectExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>

2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe FindMultiselect --recipe-option "find=blacklist" --recipe-option "filePattern='**/*.java'"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-core:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_CORE}}
```
