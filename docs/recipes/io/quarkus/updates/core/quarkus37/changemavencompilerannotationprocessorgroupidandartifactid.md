## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | oldGroupId | The old groupId to replace. The groupId is the first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. Supports glob expressions. | `org.hibernate` |
| `String` | oldArtifactId | The old artifactId to replace. The artifactId is the second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. Supports glob expressions. | `hibernate-jpamodelgen` |
| `String` | newGroupId | *Optional*. The new groupId to use. Defaults to the existing group id. | `org.hibernate.orm` |
| `String` | newArtifactId | *Optional*. The new artifactId to use. Defaults to the existing artifact id. | `hibernate-jpamodelgen` |
| `String` | newVersion | *Optional*. An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `Boolean` | overrideManagedVersion | *Optional*. If the new annotation processor has a managed version, this flag can be used to explicitly set the version on the annotation processor. The default for this flag is `false`. |  |
| `Boolean` | enforceManagedVersion | *Optional*. If the new annotation processor has a managed version, this flag can be used to explicitly set the version on the annotation processor with the version of the managed dependency. The default for this flag is `false`. |  |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeMavenCompilerAnnotationProcessorGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeMavenCompilerAnnotationProcessorGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample
displayName: Change Maven Compiler plugin annotation processor groupId, artifactId and/or the version example
recipeList:
  - io.quarkus.updates.core.quarkus37.ChangeMavenCompilerAnnotationProcessorGroupIdAndArtifactId:
      oldGroupId: org.hibernate
      oldArtifactId: hibernate-jpamodelgen
      newGroupId: org.hibernate.orm
      newArtifactId: hibernate-jpamodelgen
      newVersion: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeMavenCompilerAnnotationProcessorGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-third-party:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_THIRD_PARTY}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangeMavenCompilerAnnotationProcessorGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-third-party:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_THIRD_PARTY}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>

2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangeMavenCompilerAnnotationProcessorGroupIdAndArtifactId --recipe-option "oldGroupId=org.hibernate" --recipe-option "oldArtifactId=hibernate-jpamodelgen" --recipe-option "newGroupId=org.hibernate.orm" --recipe-option "newArtifactId=hibernate-jpamodelgen" --recipe-option "newVersion=29.X" --recipe-option "versionPattern='-jre'"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-third-party:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_THIRD_PARTY}}
```
