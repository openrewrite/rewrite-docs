## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=software.amazon.awssdk.v2migration.AddCommentToMethod), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-third-party/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-third-party/0.12.1/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
* artifactId: rewrite-third-party
* version: 0.12.1

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | methodPattern | A [method pattern](/reference/method-patterns) that is used to find matching method invocations. | `org.mockito.Matchers anyVararg()` |
| `String` | comment | A comment to add to this method. | `This method is not supported in AWS SDK for Java v2.` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddCommentToMethodExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddCommentToMethodExample
displayName: Add a comment to a method example
recipeList:
  - software.amazon.awssdk.v2migration.AddCommentToMethod:
      methodPattern: org.mockito.Matchers anyVararg()
      comment: This method is not supported in AWS SDK for Java v2.
```

Now that `com.yourorg.AddCommentToMethodExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-third-party:0.12.1 in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.28.1")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.AddCommentToMethodExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-third-party:0.12.1")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe AddCommentToMethodExample
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-third-party:0.12.1
