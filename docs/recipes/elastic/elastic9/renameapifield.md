# Rename `Elasticsearch valueBody()` methods

**io.moderne.elastic.elastic9.RenameApiField**

_In Elasticsearch Java Client 9.0, the generic `valueBody()` method and `valueBody(...)` builder methods have been replaced with specific getter and setter methods that better reflect the type of data being returned. Similarly, for `GetRepositoryResponse`, the `result` field also got altered to `repositories`._
