# Change Extra Property

**org.openrewrite.gradle.ChangeExtraProperty**

_Gradle's [ExtraPropertiesExtension](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.ExtraPropertiesExtension.html) is a commonly used mechanism for setting arbitrary key/value pairs on a project. This recipe will change the value of a property with the given key name if that key can be found. It assumes that the value being set is a String literal. Does not add the value if it does not already exist._

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeExtraPropertyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeExtraPropertyExample
displayName: Change Extra Property example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.ChangeExtraProperty:
      key: foo
      value: bar
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeExtraPropertyExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangeExtraPropertyExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangeExtraProperty --recipe-option "key=foo" --recipe-option "value=bar"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-gradle:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_GRADLE}}
```
