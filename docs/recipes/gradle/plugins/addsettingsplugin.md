## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | pluginId | The plugin id to apply. | `com.jfrog.bintray` |
| `String` | version | *Optional*. An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. You can also use `latest.release` for the latest available version and `latest.patch` if the current version is a valid semantic version. For more details, you can look at the documentation page of [version selectors](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/dependency-version-selectors). Defaults to `latest.release`. | `3.x` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `Boolean` | apply | *Optional*. Immediate apply the plugin. Defaults to `true`. Valid options: `true`, `false` |  |
| `Boolean` | acceptTransitive | *Optional*. Some plugins apply other plugins. When this is set to true no plugin declaration will be added if the plugin is already applied transitively. When this is set to false the plugin will be added explicitly even if it is already applied transitively. Defaults to `true`. Valid options: `true`, `false` |  |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample
displayName: Add Gradle settings plugin example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.plugins.AddSettingsPlugin:
      pluginId: com.jfrog.bintray
      version: 3.x
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.AddSettingsPluginExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe AddSettingsPlugin --recipe-option "pluginId=com.jfrog.bintray" --recipe-option "version=3.x" --recipe-option "versionPattern='-jre'"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-gradle:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_GRADLE}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
