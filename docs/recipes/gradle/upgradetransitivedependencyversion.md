# Upgrade transitive Gradle dependencies

**org.openrewrite.gradle.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion**

_Upgrades the version of a transitive dependency in a Gradle build file. There are many ways to do this in Gradle, so the mechanism for upgrading a transitive dependency must be considered carefully depending on your style of dependency management._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-gradle/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/gradle/UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-gradle/8.36.0/jar)

* groupId: org.openrewrite
* artifactId: rewrite-gradle
* version: 8.36.0

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | groupId | The first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. This can be a glob expression. | `com.fasterxml.jackson*` |
| `String` | artifactId | The second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. This can be a glob expression. | `jackson-module*` |
| `String` | version | *Optional*. An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. You can also use `latest.release` for the latest available version and `latest.patch` if the current version is a valid semantic version. For more details, you can look at the documentation page of [version selectors](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/dependency-version-selectors). Defaults to `latest.release`. | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'newVersion' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `String` | because | *Optional*. The reason for upgrading the transitive dependency. For example, we could be responding to a vulnerability. | `CVE-2021-1234` |
| `List` | onlyForConfigurations | *Optional*. A list of configurations to consider during the upgrade. For example, For example using `implementation, runtimeOnly`, we could be responding to a deployable asset vulnerability only (ignoring test scoped vulnerabilities). | `implementation, runtimeOnly` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersionExample
displayName: Upgrade transitive Gradle dependencies example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion:
      groupId: com.fasterxml.jackson*
      artifactId: jackson-module*
      version: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
      because: CVE-2021-1234
      onlyForConfigurations: implementation, runtimeOnly
```

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersionExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="project-type">
<TabItem value="gradle" title="Gradle">
    1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
    ```groovy title="build.gradle"
    plugins {
        id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.24.0")
    }
    
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("com.yourorg.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersionExample")
        exportDatatables = true
    }
    
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    ```
    2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" title="Moderne CLI">
    You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

    ```shell title="shell"
    mod run . --recipe UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersionExample
    ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
