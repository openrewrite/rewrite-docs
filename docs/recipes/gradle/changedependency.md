# Change Gradle dependency

**org.openrewrite.gradle.ChangeDependency**

_Change a Gradle dependency coordinates. The `newGroupId` or `newArtifactId` **MUST** be different from before._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | oldGroupId | The old groupId to replace. The groupId is the first part of a dependency coordinate 'com.google.guava:guava:VERSION'. Supports glob expressions. | `org.openrewrite.recipe` |
| `String` | oldArtifactId | The old artifactId to replace. The artifactId is the second part of a dependency coordinate 'com.google.guava:guava:VERSION'. Supports glob expressions. | `rewrite-testing-frameworks` |
| `String` | newGroupId | *Optional*. The new groupId to use. Defaults to the existing group id. | `corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe` |
| `String` | newArtifactId | *Optional*. The new artifactId to use. Defaults to the existing artifact id. | `rewrite-testing-frameworks` |
| `String` | newVersion | *Optional*. An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. You can also use `latest.release` for the latest available version and `latest.patch` if the current version is a valid semantic version. For more details, you can look at the documentation page of [version selectors](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/dependency-version-selectors). | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'version' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `Boolean` | overrideManagedVersion | *Optional*. If the old dependency has a managed version, this flag can be used to explicitly set the version on the new dependency. WARNING: No check is done on the NEW dependency to verify if it is managed, it relies on whether the OLD dependency had a managed version. The default for this flag is `false`. |  |
| `Boolean` | changeManagedDependency | *Optional*. Also update the dependency management section. The default for this flag is `true`. |  |

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangeDependencyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangeDependencyExample
displayName: Change Gradle dependency example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.gradle.ChangeDependency:
      oldGroupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
      oldArtifactId: rewrite-testing-frameworks
      newGroupId: corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe
      newArtifactId: rewrite-testing-frameworks
      newVersion: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangeDependencyExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangeDependencyExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangeDependency --recipe-option "oldGroupId=org.openrewrite.recipe" --recipe-option "oldArtifactId=rewrite-testing-frameworks" --recipe-option "newGroupId=corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe" --recipe-option "newArtifactId=rewrite-testing-frameworks" --recipe-option "newVersion=29.X" --recipe-option "versionPattern='-jre'"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-gradle:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_GRADLE}}
```
