# Find and fix vulnerable npm dependencies

**org.openrewrite.nodejs.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `Boolean` | addMarkers | *Optional*. Report each vulnerability as search result markers. When enabled you can see which dependencies are bringing in vulnerable transitives in the diff view. By default these markers are omitted, making it easier to see version upgrades within the diff. |  |

### Vulnerability report
**org.openrewrite.nodejs.table.VulnerabilityReport**

_A vulnerability report that includes detailed information about the affected artifact and the corresponding CVEs._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CVE | The CVE number. |
| Package name | The package name. |
| Version | The resolved version. |
| Fixed in version | The minimum version that is no longer vulnerable. |
| Last affected version | The last version which is vulnerable. |
| Fixable with version update only | Whether the vulnerability is likely to be fixed by increasing the dependency version only, with no code modifications required. This is a heuristic which assumes that the dependency is accurately versioned according to [semver](https://semver.org/). |
| Summary | The summary of the CVE. |
| Base score | The calculated base score. |
| Depth | Zero for direct dependencies. |
