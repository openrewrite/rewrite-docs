# Analyze a .NET project using upgrade-assistant

**org.openrewrite.dotnet.UpgradeAssistantAnalyze**

_Run [upgrade-assistant analyze](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) across a repository to analyze changes required to upgrade projects to a newer version of .NET. This recipe will generate an `org.openrewrite.dotnet.UpgradeAssistantAnalysis` data table containing the report details._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-dotnet/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/dotnet/UpgradeAssistantAnalyze.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-dotnet/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-dotnet/)

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | targetFramework | Target framework to which source project should be upgraded. | `net9.0` |
| `String` | privacyMode | Specifies how much data is included in the generated data table. Valid options: `Unrestricted`, `Protected`, `Restricted` | `Restricted` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradeAssistantAnalyzeExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradeAssistantAnalyzeExample
displayName: Analyze a .NET project using upgrade-assistant example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.dotnet.UpgradeAssistantAnalyze:
      targetFramework: net9.0
      privacyMode: Restricted
```

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradeAssistantAnalyzeExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-dotnet:{{VERSION_REWRITE_DOTNET}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.UpgradeAssistantAnalyzeExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-dotnet:{{VERSION_REWRITE_DOTNET}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.UpgradeAssistantAnalyzeExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-dotnet</artifactId>
            <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_DOTNET}}</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe UpgradeAssistantAnalyzeExample
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-dotnet:{{VERSION_REWRITE_DOTNET}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
