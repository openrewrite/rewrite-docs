# Replace runners for a job

**org.openrewrite.github.ReplaceRunners**

_Replaces the runners of a given job._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-github-actions/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/github/ReplaceRunners.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-github-actions/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-github-actions/)

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | jobName | The name of the job to update | `build` |
| `List` | runners | The new list of runners to set | `ubuntu-latest` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ReplaceRunnersExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ReplaceRunnersExample
displayName: Replace runners for a job example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.github.ReplaceRunners:
      jobName: build
      runners: ubuntu-latest
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ReplaceRunnersExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-github-actions:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GITHUB_ACTIONS}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">


<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ReplaceRunners --recipe-option "jobName=build" --recipe-option "runners=ubuntu-latest"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-github-actions:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GITHUB_ACTIONS}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
