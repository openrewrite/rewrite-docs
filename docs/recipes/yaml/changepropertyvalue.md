# Change YAML property

**org.openrewrite.yaml.ChangePropertyValue**

_Change a YAML property. Expects dot notation for nested YAML mappings, similar to how Spring Boot interprets `application.yml` files._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | propertyKey | The key to look for. Supports glob patterns. | `management.metrics.binders.*.enabled` |
| `String` | newValue | The new value to be used for key specified by `propertyKey`. | `newValue` |
| `String` | oldValue | *Optional*. Only change the property value if it matches the configured `oldValue`. | `oldValue` |
| `Boolean` | regex | *Optional*. Default `false`. If enabled, `oldValue` will be interpreted as a Regular Expression, to replace only all parts that match the regex. Capturing group can be used in `newValue`. |  |
| `Boolean` | relaxedBinding | *Optional*. Whether to match the `propertyKey` using [relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding) rules. Default is `true`. Set to `false`  to use exact matching. |  |
| `String` | filePattern | *Optional*. A glob expression representing a file path to search for (relative to the project root). Blank/null matches all. | `.github/workflows/*.yml` |

## Example

|propertyKey|`my.prop`|
|newValue|`bar`|

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample
displayName: Change YAML property example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.yaml.ChangePropertyValue:
      propertyKey: management.metrics.binders.*.enabled
      newValue: newValue
      oldValue: oldValue
      filePattern: .github/workflows/*.yml
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("latest.release")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ChangePropertyValueExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangePropertyValue --recipe-option "propertyKey=management.metrics.binders.*.enabled" --recipe-option "newValue=newValue" --recipe-option "oldValue=oldValue" --recipe-option "filePattern=.github/workflows/*.yml"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-yaml:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_YAML}}
```
