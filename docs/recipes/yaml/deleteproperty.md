# Delete property

**org.openrewrite.yaml.DeleteProperty**

_Delete a YAML property. Nested YAML mappings are interpreted as dot separated property names, i.e. as Spring Boot interprets application.yml files like `a.b.c.d` or `a.b.c:d`._

## Recipe source

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | propertyKey | The key to be deleted. | `management.metrics.binders.files.enabled` |
| `Boolean` | coalesce | *Optional*. (Deprecated: in a future version, this recipe will always use the `false` behavior) Simplify nested map hierarchies into their simplest dot separated property form. |  |
| `Boolean` | relaxedBinding | *Optional*. Whether to match the `propertyKey` using [relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding) rules. Defaults to `true`. If you want to use exact matching in your search, set this to `false`. |  |
| `String` | filePattern | *Optional*. A glob expression representing a file path to search for (relative to the project root). Blank/null matches all. | `.github/workflows/*.yml` |

## Example

###### Parameters
| Parameter | Value |
| -- | -- |
|propertyKey|`management.metrics.binders.files.enabled`|
|coalesce|`null`|
|relaxedBinding|`null`|
|filePattern|`null`|


###### Unchanged
```yaml
management.metrics.binders.files.enabled: true
```


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.DeletePropertyExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.DeletePropertyExample
displayName: Delete property example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.yaml.DeleteProperty:
      propertyKey: management.metrics.binders.files.enabled
      filePattern: .github/workflows/*.yml
```

Now that `com.yourorg.DeletePropertyExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.DeletePropertyExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>

        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>

          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.DeletePropertyExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe DeleteProperty --recipe-option "propertyKey=management.metrics.binders.files.enabled" --recipe-option "filePattern=.github/workflows/*.yml"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-yaml:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_YAML}}
```
