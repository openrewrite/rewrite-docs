# Upgrade Spring dependencies

**org.openrewrite.maven.spring.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependencies**

_Upgrades dependencies according to the specified version of spring boot. Spring boot has many direct and transitive dependencies. When a module has an explicit dependency on one of these it may also need to be upgraded to match the version used by spring boot._

## Recipe source

This recipe is available under the [Moderne Source Available License](https://docs.moderne.io/licensing/moderne-source-available-license).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | fromVersion | XRage pattern for spring version used to limit which projects should be updated | ` 2.7.+` |
| `String` | toVersion | Upgrade version of `org.springframework.boot` | `3.0.0-M3` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependenciesExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependenciesExample
displayName: Upgrade Spring dependencies example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.spring.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependencies:
      fromVersion:  2.7.+
      toVersion: 3.0.0-M3
```

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependenciesExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependenciesExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-spring</artifactId>
            <version>{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe UpgradeExplicitSpringBootDependencies --recipe-option "fromVersion= 2.7.+" --recipe-option "toVersion=3.0.0-M3"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_SPRING}}
```
