# Upgrade Maven dependency version

**org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradeDependencyVersion**

_Upgrade the version of a dependency by specifying a group and (optionally) an artifact using Node Semver advanced range selectors, allowing more precise control over version updates to patch or minor releases._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-maven/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/maven/UpgradeDependencyVersion.java), 
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), 
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-maven/)
## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | groupId | The first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. This can be a glob expression. | `com.fasterxml.jackson*` |
| `String` | artifactId | The second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. This can be a glob expression. | `jackson-module*` |
| `String` | newVersion | An exact version number or node-style semver selector used to select the version number. You can also use `latest.release` for the latest available version and `latest.patch` if the current version is a valid semantic version. For more details, you can look at the documentation page of [version selectors](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/dependency-version-selectors) | `29.X` |
| `String` | versionPattern | *Optional*. Allows version selection to be extended beyond the original Node Semver semantics. So for example,Setting 'newVersion' to "25-29" can be paired with a metadata pattern of "-jre" to select Guava 29.0-jre | `-jre` |
| `Boolean` | overrideManagedVersion | *Optional*. This flag can be set to explicitly override a managed dependency's version. The default for this flag is `false`. |  |
| `List` | retainVersions | *Optional*. Accepts a list of GAVs. For each GAV, if it is a project direct dependency, and it is removed from dependency management after the changes from this recipe, then it will be retained with an explicit version. The version can be omitted from the GAV to use the old value from dependency management | `com.jcraft:jsch` |

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample
displayName: Upgrade Maven dependency version example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradeDependencyVersion:
      groupId: com.fasterxml.jackson*
      artifactId: jackson-module*
      newVersion: 29.X
      versionPattern: '-jre'
      retainVersions: com.jcraft:jsch
```

Now that `com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.UpgradeDependencyVersionExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe UpgradeDependencyVersion --recipe-option "groupId=com.fasterxml.jackson*" --recipe-option "artifactId=jackson-module*" --recipe-option "newVersion=29.X" --recipe-option "versionPattern='-jre'" --recipe-option "retainVersions=com.jcraft:jsch"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-maven:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_MAVEN}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
