_Change the groupId and/or the artifactId of a specified Maven plugin._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/blob/main/rewrite-maven/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/maven/ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactId.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite/rewrite-maven/)

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | oldGroupId | The old group ID to replace. The group ID is the first part of a plugin coordinate 'com.google.guava:guava:VERSION'. Supports glob expressions. | `org.openrewrite.recipe` |
| `String` | oldArtifactId | The old artifactId to replace. The artifact ID is the second part of a plugin coordinate 'com.google.guava:guava:VERSION'. Supports glob expressions. | `my-deprecated-maven-plugin` |
| `String` | newGroupId | *Optional*. The new group ID to use. Defaults to the existing group ID. | `corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe` |
| `String` | newArtifactId | *Optional*. The new artifact ID to use. Defaults to the existing artifact ID. | `my-new-maven-plugin` |
| `String` | newArtifact | *Optional*. The new artifact ID to use. Defaults to the existing artifact ID. This property is deprecated, use newArtifactId instead. | `my-new-maven-plugin` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample
displayName: Change Maven plugin group and artifact ID example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactId:
      oldGroupId: org.openrewrite.recipe
      oldArtifactId: my-deprecated-maven-plugin
      newGroupId: corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe
      newArtifactId: my-new-maven-plugin
      newArtifact: my-new-maven-plugin
```

Now that `com.yourorg.ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactIdExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ChangePluginGroupIdAndArtifactId --recipe-option "oldGroupId=org.openrewrite.recipe" --recipe-option "oldArtifactId=my-deprecated-maven-plugin" --recipe-option "newGroupId=corp.internal.openrewrite.recipe" --recipe-option "newArtifactId=my-new-maven-plugin" --recipe-option "newArtifact=my-new-maven-plugin"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-maven:{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
