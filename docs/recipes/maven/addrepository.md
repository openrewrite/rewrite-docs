## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddRepositoryExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddRepositoryExample
displayName: Add repository example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.AddRepository:
      id: repo-id
      url: http://myrepo.maven.com/repo
      repoName: My Great Repo Name
      layout: default
      snapshotsChecksumPolicy: warn
      snapshotsUpdatePolicy: always
      releasesChecksumPolicy: fail
      releasesUpdatePolicy: never
      type: Repository
```

Now that `com.yourorg.AddRepositoryExample` has been defined, activate it in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">

<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.AddRepositoryExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe AddRepository --recipe-option "id=repo-id" --recipe-option "url=http://myrepo.maven.com/repo" --recipe-option "repoName=My Great Repo Name" --recipe-option "layout=default" --recipe-option "snapshotsChecksumPolicy=warn" --recipe-option "snapshotsUpdatePolicy=always" --recipe-option "releasesChecksumPolicy=fail" --recipe-option "releasesUpdatePolicy=never" --recipe-option "type=Repository"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite:rewrite-maven:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_REWRITE_MAVEN}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
