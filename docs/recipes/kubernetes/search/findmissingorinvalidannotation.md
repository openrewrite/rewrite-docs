# Find annotation

**org.openrewrite.kubernetes.search.FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotation**

_Find annotations that optionally match a given value._

## Recipe source

[GitHub](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-kubernetes/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/kubernetes/search/FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotation.java), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-kubernetes/issues), [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.openrewrite.recipe/rewrite-kubernetes/)

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | annotationName | The name of the annotation to search for the existence of. | `mycompany.io/annotation` |
| `String` | value | *Optional*. An optional regex that will validate values that match. | `value.*` |
| `String` | fileMatcher | *Optional*. Matching files will be modified. This is a glob expression. | `**/pod-*.yml` |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotationExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotationExample
displayName: Find annotation example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.kubernetes.search.FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotation:
      annotationName: mycompany.io/annotation
      value: value.*
      fileMatcher: '**/pod-*.yml'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotationExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-kubernetes:{{VERSION_REWRITE_KUBERNETES}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">


<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe FindMissingOrInvalidAnnotation --recipe-option "annotationName=mycompany.io/annotation" --recipe-option "value=value.*" --recipe-option "fileMatcher='**/pod-*.yml'"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-kubernetes:{{VERSION_REWRITE_KUBERNETES}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
