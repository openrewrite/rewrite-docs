# Find and fix vulnerable Nuget dependencies

**org.openrewrite.csharp.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

## Recipe source

This recipe is only available to users of [Moderne](https://docs.moderne.io/).


This recipe is available under the [Moderne Proprietary License](https://docs.moderne.io/licensing/overview).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | addMarkers | *Optional*. Report each vulnerability as search result markers. When enabled you can see which dependencies are bringing in vulnerable transitives in the diff view. By default these markers are omitted, making it easier to see version upgrades within the diff. |  |
| `String` | minimumSeverity | *Optional*. Only fix vulnerabilities with a severity level equal to or higher than the specified minimum. Vulnerabilities are classified as low, moderate, high, or critical based on their potential impact. Default is `low`, which includes all severity levels. Valid options: `low`, `moderate`, `high`, `critical` | `moderate` |
| `String` | cvePattern | *Optional*. Only fix vulnerabilities matching this regular expression pattern. This allows filtering to specific CVEs or CVE ranges. For example, `CVE-2023-.*` will only check for CVEs from 2023, `CVE-(2022\|2023)-.*` will check for CVEs from 2022 or 2023, `CVE-2021-44228\|CVE-2022-23305` will check for those specific CVEs. If not specified, all CVEs will be checked (subject to other filters). | `CVE-2023-.*` |
