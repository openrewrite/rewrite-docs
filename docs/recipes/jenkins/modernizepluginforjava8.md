# Modernize a Jenkins plugin to the latest versions supported by Java 8

**org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8**

_This recipe is intended to break down the modernization of very old plugins into distinct steps. It allows modernizing all tooling up to the last versions that supported Java 8. This can then be followed by another recipe that makes the jump to Java 11._

## Usage

This recipe has no required configuration options. It can be activated by adding a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins` in your build file or by running a shell command (in which case no build changes are needed):
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JENKINS}}")
}
```

2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle-init-script" label="Gradle init script">

1. Create a file named `init.gradle` in the root of your project.

```groovy title="init.gradle"
initscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2" }
    }
    dependencies { classpath("org.openrewrite:plugin:{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}") }
}
rootProject {
    plugins.apply(org.openrewrite.gradle.RewritePlugin)
    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_JENKINS}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run the recipe.

```shell title="shell"
gradle --init-script init.gradle rewriteRun
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven POM">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>

        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>

<TabItem value="maven-command-line" label="Maven Command Line">
You will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jenkins:RELEASE -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.jenkins.ModernizePluginForJava8 -Drewrite.exportDatatables=true
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe ModernizePluginForJava8
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
