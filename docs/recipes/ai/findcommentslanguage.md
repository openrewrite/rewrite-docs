<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("io.moderne.ai.FindCommentsLanguage")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-ai-search:{{VERSION_REWRITE_AI_SEARCH}}")

    dependencies {
        rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-ai-search:{{VERSION_REWRITE_AI_SEARCH}}")
    }
    rewrite {
        activeRecipe("io.moderne.ai.FindCommentsLanguage")
        setExportDatatables(true)
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        if (repositories.isEmpty()) {
            repositories {
                mavenCentral()
