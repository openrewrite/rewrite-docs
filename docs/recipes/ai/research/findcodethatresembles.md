# Find method invocations that resemble a pattern

**io.moderne.ai.research.FindCodeThatResembles**

_This recipe uses two phase AI approach to find a method invocation that resembles a search string._

## Recipe source

This recipe is only available to users of [Moderne](https://docs.moderne.io/).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | resembles | The text, either a natural language description or a code sample, that you are looking for. | `HTTP request with Content-Type application/json` |
| `int` | k | Since AI based matching has a higher latency than rules based matching, we do a first pass to find the top k methods using embeddings. To narrow the scope, you can specify the top k methods as method filters. | `5` |

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe FindCodeThatResembles --recipe-option "resembles=HTTP request with Content-Type application/json" --recipe-option "k=5"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell

## Data Tables

### Code Search
**io.moderne.ai.table.CodeSearch**

_Searches for method invocations that resemble a natural language query._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source | Source |
| Method | Method invocation |
| Query | Natural language query |
| Result of first models | First two embeddings models result, where -1 means negative match, 0 means unsure, and 1 means positive match. |
| Called second model | True if the generative model was used. |
| Result of second model | Second generative model's result. |

### Top-K Method Matcher
**io.moderne.ai.table.TopKMethodMatcher**

_Result from the scanning recipe for top-k method patterns that match the query._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Method Pattern | Method invocation pattern. |
| Method Signature | Method invocation signature. |
| Distance | The distance between the query and the method invocation. |
| Query | The natural language search query. |

### Embedding performance
**io.moderne.ai.table.EmbeddingPerformance**

_Latency characteristics of uses of embedding models._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source file | The source file that the method call occurred in. |
| Number of requests | The count of requests made to the model. |
| Histogram | The latency histogram of the requests made to the model (counts). The histogram is a non-cumulative fixed distribution of 100 buckets of 0.01 second each. |
| Max latency | The maximum embedding latency. |

### Generative model performance
**io.moderne.ai.table.GenerativeModelPerformance**

_Latency characteristics of uses of generative models._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source file | The source file that the method call occurred in. |
| Number of requests | The count of requests made to the model. |
| Histogram | The latency histogram of the requests made to the model (counts). The histogram is a non-cumulative fixed distribution of 100 buckets of 1 second each. |
| Max latency | The maximum embedding latency. |

### Suggested method patterns
**io.moderne.ai.table.SuggestedMethodPatterns**

_As the next step after the AI-based searching for method invocations, you may want to do rule-based method searching using the recommended method patterns._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Method | Method invocation |
| Method Pattern | Method invocation pattern. |
| Query | The natural language search query. |

### Source files that had results
**org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileResults**

_Source files that were modified by the recipe run._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path before the run | The source path of the file before the run. `null` when a source file was created during the run. |
| Source path after the run | A recipe may modify the source path. This is the path after the run. `null` when a source file was deleted during the run. |
| Parent of the recipe that made changes | In a hierarchical recipe, the parent of the recipe that made a change. Empty if this is the root of a hierarchy or if the recipe is not hierarchical at all. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Estimated time saving | An estimated effort that a developer to fix manually instead of using this recipe, in unit of seconds. |
| Cycle | The recipe cycle in which the change was made. |

### Source files that errored on a recipe
**org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileErrors**

_The details of all errors produced by a recipe run._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Source path | The file that failed to parse. |
| Recipe that made changes | The specific recipe that made a change. |
| Stack trace | The stack trace of the failure. |

### Recipe performance
**org.openrewrite.table.RecipeRunStats**

_Statistics used in analyzing the performance of recipes._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The recipe | The recipe whose stats are being measured both individually and cumulatively. |
| Source file count | The number of source files the recipe ran over. |
| Source file changed count | The number of source files which were changed in the recipe run. Includes files created, deleted, and edited. |

| Cumulative edit time | The total time spent across the editing phase of this recipe. |
| 99th percentile edit time | 99 out of 100 edits completed in this amount of time. |
| Max edit time | The max time editing any one source file. |
