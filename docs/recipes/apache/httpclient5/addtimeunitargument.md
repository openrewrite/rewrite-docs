# Adds a TimeUnit argument to the matched method invocations

**org.openrewrite.apache.httpclient5.AddTimeUnitArgument**

_In Apache Http Client 5.x migration, an extra TimeUnit argument is required in the timeout and duration methods. Previously in 4.x, all these methods were implicitly having the timeout or duration expressed in milliseconds, but in 5.x the unit of the timeout or duration is required. So, by default this recipe adds `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`, it is possible to specify this as a parameter. Since all affected methods of the Apache Http Client 5.x migration only have one integer/long argument, the recipe applies with matched method invocations of exactly one parameter._

## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly (unless you are running them via the Moderne CLI). To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.AddTimeUnitArgumentExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.AddTimeUnitArgumentExample
displayName: Adds a TimeUnit argument to the matched method invocations example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.apache.httpclient5.AddTimeUnitArgument:
      methodPattern: org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig.Builder setConnectionRequestTimeout(int)
      timeUnit: MILLISECONDS
```

Now that `com.yourorg.AddTimeUnitArgumentExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-apache:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_APACHE}}` in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("{{VERSION_REWRITE_GRADLE_PLUGIN}}")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.AddTimeUnitArgumentExample")
    setExportDatatables(true)
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-apache:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_APACHE}}")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{{VERSION_REWRITE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}}</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.AddTimeUnitArgumentExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-apache</artifactId>
            <version>{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_APACHE}}</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe AddTimeUnitArgument --recipe-option "methodPattern=org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig.Builder setConnectionRequestTimeout(int)" --recipe-option "timeUnit=MILLISECONDS"
```

If the recipe is not available locally, then you can install it using:
```shell
mod config recipes jar install org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-apache:{{VERSION_ORG_OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_REWRITE_APACHE}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
