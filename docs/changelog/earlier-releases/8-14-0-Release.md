## New Recipes

* org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.RelocatedDependencyCheck: Find Maven and Gradle dependencies and Maven plugins that have relocated to a new `groupId` or `artifactId`. Relocation information comes from the oga-maven-plugin maintained by Jonathan Lermitage, Filipe Roque and others. This recipe makes no changes to any source file by default. Add `changeDependencies=true` to change dependencies, but note that you might need to run additional recipes to update imports and adopt other breaking changes. 
* org.openrewrite.java.migrate.MXBeanRule: Sets visibility of MBean and MXBean interfaces to public. 
* org.openrewrite.java.recipes.RecipeEqualsAndHashCodeCallSuper: Recipes are value objects, so should use `@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)`. While in most cases recipes do not extend other classes and so the option is moot, as a matter of stylistic consistency and to enforce the idea that recipes are value objects, this value should be set to `false`. 

## Removed Recipes

* **org.openrewrite.java.migrate.MXBeanNonPublic**: Sets visibility of MBean and MXBean interfaces to public. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateJavaTemplateToRewrite8**: Migrate `JavaTemplate` to accommodate Rewrite 8, due to wide open-ended usage of JavaTemplate, this recipe just apply most of common changes to pass compile and will leave some comments to require human's review. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateMarkersSearchResult**: Methods of `org.openrewrite.marker.Markers#SearchResult(..)` are deprecated and removed in rewrite 8, use `SearchResult.found()` instead. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateRecipeToRewrite8**: Rewrite Recipe Migration to version 8. While most parts can be automatically migrated, there are some complex and open-ended scenarios that require manual attention. In those cases, this recipe will add a comment to the code and request a human to review and handle it manually. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.MigrateTestToRewrite8**: Since the method `Recipe::doNext(..)` is deprecated, For unit test, change usage like `RecipeSpec.recipe(X.doNext(Y))` to `RecipeSpec.recipes(X, Y)`. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.RemoveApplicabilityTestFromYamlRecipe**: Removes any-source applicability tests from YAML recipes, as the are no longer supported in Rewrite 8 and migrates single-source applicability tests to preconditions. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedPackageClassName**: When a class moved from package A to B, update the fully qualified className accordingly. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedRecipe**: If a recipe moved between packages, update the code reference places, declarative recipes, and `activeRecipes` in pom.xml. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedRecipeXml**: Update moved package recipe in pom.xml. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.recipes.UpdateMovedRecipeYaml**: Update moved package recipe in yaml file. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.upgrade.MigrateToRewrite8**: Migrate rewrite recipe and test from version 7 to version 8.
While most parts can be automatically migrated, there are some complex and open-ended scenarios that require manual attention.
In those cases, this recipe will add a comment to the code and request a human to review and handle it manually.
Reference : Migration guide (URL to be written). 
* **org.openrewrite.java.upgrade.UpdateStaticAnalysisPackage**: Some recipes have been moved from `rewrite` to `rewrite-static-analysis`, so any referencing places should update the class package name accordingly.
