## New Recipes

* [org.openrewrite.apache.httpclient5.MigrateAuthScope](../recipes/apache/httpclient5/migrateauthscope): Replace removed constant `org.apache.http.auth.AuthScope.AuthScope.ANY` with `new org.apache.hc.client5.http.auth.AuthScope(null, -1)` 
* [org.openrewrite.github.ChangeAction](../recipes/github/changeaction): Change a GitHub Action in any `.github/workflows/*.yml` file. 
* [org.openrewrite.github.gradle.RenameGradleBuildActionToSetupGradle](../recipes/github/gradle/renamegradlebuildactiontosetupgradle): Rename the deprecated `gradle/gradle-build-action` to `gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3`. 
* [org.openrewrite.github.gradle.RenameWrapperValidationAction](../recipes/github/gradle/renamewrappervalidationaction): Rename the deprecated `gradle/wrapper-validation-action` to `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v3`. 
* [org.openrewrite.hibernate.MigrateBooleanMappings](../recipes/hibernate/migratebooleanmappings): Replaces type mapping of booleans with appropriate attribute converters. 
* [org.openrewrite.hibernate.MigrateToHibernate63](../recipes/hibernate/migratetohibernate63): This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when migrating to Hibernate 6.3.x. 
* [org.openrewrite.hibernate.MigrateToHypersistenceUtilsHibernate6.3](../recipes/hibernate/migratetohypersistenceutilshibernate6/3): This recipe will migrate any existing dependencies on `io.hypersistence:hypersistence-utils-hibernate-62` to `io.hypersistence:hypersistence-utils-hibernate-63`. 
* org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.ChangeDependencyGroupIdAndArtifactId: Change a Gradle or Maven dependency coordinate. Either the `newGroupId` or `newArtifactId` must differ from the previous value. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion](../recipes/java/dependencies/upgradetransitivedependencyversion): Upgrades the version of a transitive dependency in a Maven pom.xml or Gradle build.gradle. Leaves direct dependencies unmodified. Can be paired with the regular Upgrade Dependency Version recipe to upgrade a dependency everywhere, regardless of whether it is direct or transitive. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.logging.log4j.LoggingExceptionConcatenationRecipe](../recipes/java/logging/log4j/loggingexceptionconcatenationrecipe): By using the exception as another parameter you get the whole stack trace. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.DeprecatedCountStackFramesMethod](../recipes/java/migrate/deprecatedcountstackframesmethod): `Thread.countStackFrames()` has been removed in Java SE 14 and has been changed in this release to unconditionally throw `UnsupportedOperationException`<br /> This recipe removes the usage of this method in your application as long as the method is not assigned to a variable.<br /> For more information on the Java SE 14 deprecation of this method, see https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=8205132. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.RemovedFileIOFinalizeMethods](../recipes/java/migrate/removedfileiofinalizemethods): The `finalize` method in `java.io.FileInputStream` and `java.io.FileOutputStream` is no longer available in Java SE 12 and later. The recipe replaces it with the `close` method. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.RemovedRMIConnectorServerCredentialTypesConstant](../recipes/java/migrate/removedrmiconnectorservercredentialtypesconstant): This recipe replaces the `RMIConnectorServer.CREDENTIAL_TYPES` constant with the `RMIConnectorServer.CREDENTIALS_FILTER_PATTERN` constant. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.RemovedSSLSessionGetPeerCertificateChainMethodImpl](../recipes/java/migrate/removedsslsessiongetpeercertificatechainmethodimpl): The `javax.net.ssl.SSLSession.getPeerCertificateChain()` method implementation was removed from the SunJSSE provider and HTTP client implementation in Java SE 15.  The default implementation will now throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.  Applications using this method should be updated to use the `javax.net.ssl.SSLSession.getPeerCertificates()` method instead. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.RemovedSecurityManagerMethods](../recipes/java/migrate/removedsecuritymanagermethods): Replace `SecurityManager` methods `checkAwtEventQueueAccess()`, `checkSystemClipboardAccess()`, `checkMemberAccess()` and `checkTopLevelWindow()` deprecated in Java SE 11 by `checkPermission(new java.security.AllPermission())`. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.RemovedZipFinalizeMethods](../recipes/java/migrate/removedzipfinalizemethods): The `finalize` method in `java.util.zip.ZipFile` is replaced with the `close` method and is replaced by the `end` method in <br /> `java.util.zip.Inflater` and `java.util.zip.Deflater` as it is no longer available in Java SE 12 and later. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.SunNetSslPackageUnavailable](../recipes/java/migrate/sunnetsslpackageunavailable): The internal API `com.sun.net.ssl` is removed. The package was intended for internal use only and replacement APIs can be found in the `javax.net.ssl` package. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.guava.NoGuavaMapsNewHashMap](../recipes/java/migrate/guava/noguavamapsnewhashmap): Prefer the Java standard library over third-party usage of Guava in simple cases like this. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxEEApiToJakarta](../recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/javaxeeapitojakarta): Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, necessitating a package relocation. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.UpdateJakartaPlatform10](../recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/updatejakartaplatform10): Update Jakarta EE Platform Dependencies to 10.0.0 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddColumnAnnotation](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addcolumnannotation): When an attribute is annotated with `@ElementCollection`, a separate table is created for the attribute that includes the attribute <br />ID and value. In OpenJPA, the column for the annotated attribute is named element, whereas EclipseLink names the column based on <br />the name of the attribute. To remain compatible with tables that were created with OpenJPA, add a `@Column` annotation with the name <br />attribute set to element. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddCommonAnnotationsDependencies](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/addcommonannotationsdependencies): Add the necessary `annotation-api` dependency from Jakarta EE 8 to maintain compatibility with Java version 11 or greater. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddDefaultConstructorToEntityClass](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/adddefaultconstructortoentityclass): When a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity class has a constructor with arguments, the class must also have a default, no-argument constructor. The OpenJPA implementation automatically generates the no-argument constructor, but the EclipseLink implementation does not. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveEmbeddableId](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/removeembeddableid): According to the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, if an entity defines an attribute with an `@EmbeddedId` annotation, the embeddable class cannot contain an attribute with an `@Id` annotation. If both the `@EmbeddedId` annotation and the `@Id` annotation are defined, OpenJPA ignores the `@Id` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.UseJoinColumnForMapping](../recipes/java/migrate/javax/usejoincolumnformapping): In OpenJPA, when a relationship attribute has either a `@OneToOne` or a `@ManyToOne` annotation with a `@Column` annotation, the `@Column` annotation is treated as a `@JoinColumn` annotation. EclipseLink throws an exception that indicates that the entity class must use `@JoinColumn` instead of `@Column` to map a relationship attribute. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.MigrateDropWizardDependencies](../recipes/java/spring/boot3/migratedropwizarddependencies): Migrate dropWizard dependencies to the new artifactId, since these are changed with Spring Boot 3. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.cleanup.SimplifyTestThrows](../recipes/java/testing/cleanup/simplifytestthrows): Replace all thrown exception classes of test method signatures by `Exception`. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.AddJupiterDependencies](../recipes/java/testing/junit5/addjupiterdependencies): Adds JUnit Jupiter dependencies to a Maven or Gradle project. Junit Jupiter can be added either with the artifact junit-jupiter, or both of junit-jupiter-api and junit-jupiter-engine. This adds "junit-jupiter" dependency unless "junit-jupiter-api" or "junit-jupiter-engine" are already present. 
* [org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradeTransitiveDependencyVersion](../recipes/maven/upgradetransitivedependencyversion): Upgrades the version of a transitive dependency in a Maven pom file. Leaves direct dependencies unmodified. Can be paired with the regular Upgrade Dependency Version recipe to upgrade a dependency everywhere, regardless of whether it is direct or transitive. 
* [org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.ReplaceCollectionToArrayArgWithEmptyArray](../recipes/staticanalysis/replacecollectiontoarrayargwithemptyarray): Changes new array creation with `Collection#toArray(T[])` to use an empty array argument, which is better for performance.<br /><br />According to the `Collection#toArray(T[])` documentation:<br /><br />> If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.<br /><br />However, although it's not intuitive, allocating a right-sized array ahead of time to pass to the API appears to be [generally worse for performance](https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/#_conclusion) according to benchmarking and JVM developers due to a number of implementation details in both Java and the virtual machine.<br /><br />H2 achieved significant performance gains by [switching to empty arrays instead pre-sized ones](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/311). 

## Removed Recipes

* **org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.MaybeAddJakartaServletApi**: Adds the `jakarta.servlet-api` dependency, unless the project already uses `spring-boot-starter-web`, which transitively includes a compatible implementation under a different GAV.
