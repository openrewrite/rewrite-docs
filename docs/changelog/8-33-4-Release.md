## New Recipes

* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.RemoveBooleanFlag](../recipes/featureflags/removebooleanflag): Replace method invocations for feature key with value, and simplify constant if branch execution. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.ff4j.RemoveCheck](../recipes/featureflags/ff4j/removecheck): Replace `check()` invocations for `featureKey` with `replacementValue`, and simplify constant if branch execution. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.ff4j.search.FindFeatureFlag](../recipes/featureflags/ff4j/search/findfeatureflag): Find a FF4j feature flag. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.launchdarkly.ChangeVariationDefault](../recipes/featureflags/launchdarkly/changevariationdefault): Change the default value for `Variation` invocations for feature key. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.launchdarkly.MigrateUserToContext](../recipes/featureflags/launchdarkly/migrateusertocontext): Migrate from `LDUser` and `LDUser.Builder` to `LDContext` and `ContextBuilder`. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.launchdarkly.RemoveBoolVariation](../recipes/featureflags/launchdarkly/removeboolvariation): Replace `boolVariation` invocations for feature key with value, and simplify constant if branch execution. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.launchdarkly.UpgradeLaunchDarkly6](../recipes/featureflags/launchdarkly/upgradelaunchdarkly6): This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when migrating to LaunchDarkly 6.x. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.launchdarkly.UpgradeLaunchDarkly7](../recipes/featureflags/launchdarkly/upgradelaunchdarkly7): This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when migrating to LaunchDarkly 7.x. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.launchdarkly.search.FindFeatureFlag](../recipes/featureflags/launchdarkly/search/findfeatureflag): Find a LaunchDarkly feature flag. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.openfeature.RemoveGetBooleanValue](../recipes/featureflags/openfeature/removegetbooleanvalue): Replace `getBooleanValue()` invocations for `featureKey` with `replacementValue`, and simplify constant if branch execution. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.openfeature.search.FindFeatureFlag](../recipes/featureflags/openfeature/search/findfeatureflag): Find an OpenFeature feature flag. 
* [org.openrewrite.featureflags.search.FindFeatureFlag](../recipes/featureflags/search/findfeatureflag): Find a feature flag matching method pattern.

* [org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.SoftwareBillOfMaterials](../recipes/java/dependencies/softwarebillofmaterials): Produces a software bill of materials (SBOM) for a project. An SBOM is a complete list of all dependencies used in a project, including transitive dependencies. The produced SBOM is in the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) XML format. Supports Gradle and Maven. Places a file named sbom.xml adjacent to the Gradle or Maven build file. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.RemovedRuntimeTraceMethods](../recipes/java/migrate/removedruntimetracemethods): The `traceInstructions` and `traceMethodCalls` methods in `java.lang.Runtime` were deprecated in Java SE 9 and are no longer available in Java SE 13 and later.  The recipe removes the invocations of these methods since the method invocations do nothing functionally. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.guava.NoGuavaMapsNewTreeMap](../recipes/java/migrate/guava/noguavamapsnewtreemap): Prefer the Java standard library over third-party usage of Guava in simple cases like this.

* [org.openrewrite.java.search.ClasspathTypeCounts](../recipes/java/search/classpathtypecounts): Emit one data table row per source set in a project, with the number of types in the source set.

* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.assertj.SimplifyAssertJAssertion](../recipes/java/testing/assertj/simplifyassertjassertion): Simplify AssertJ assertions by replacing them with more expressiove dedicated assertions. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.assertj.SimplifyAssertJAssertions](../recipes/java/testing/assertj/simplifyassertjassertions): Replace AssertJ assertions where a dedicated assertion is available for the same actual value. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.testing.cleanup.AssertLiteralBooleanToFailRecipe](../recipes/java/testing/cleanup/assertliteralbooleantofailrecipe): Using fail is more direct and clear. 
* [org.openrewrite.micrometer.UpgradeMicrometer_1_13](../recipes/micrometer/upgrademicrometer_1_13): Migrate applications to the latest Micrometer 1.13 release. This recipe will modify an application's build files, make changes to deprecated/preferred APIs, and migrate configuration settings that have changes between versions as described in the [Micrometer 1.13 migration guide](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/wiki/1.13-Migration-Guide). 
* [org.openrewrite.nodejs.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck](../recipes/nodejs/dependencyvulnerabilitycheck): This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable.
