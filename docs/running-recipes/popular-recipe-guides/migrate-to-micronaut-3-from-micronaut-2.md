# Migrate to Micronaut 3 from Micronaut 2

In this guide we'll look at using OpenRewrite to perform an automated migration from Micronaut 2.x to Micronaut 3.x

## Configuration

See various ways you can configure your project to run this recipe on the [recipe reference page](../../recipes/java/micronaut/micronaut2to3migration.md). This is also where you can find the full list of changes it will make.

Once you've configured your project, you're ready to execute the migration by running `mvn rewrite:run` or `gradlew rewriteRun`. After running the migration you can inspect the results with `git diff` (or equivalent), manually fix anything that wasn't able to be migrated automatically, and commit the results.

### Before and After

**Deprecated Exception Handler constructors**

Several Micronaut `ExceptionHandlers` have been refactored such that the no-args constructor has been deprecated and replaced with one taking an `ErrorResponseProcessor`:

<Tabs groupId="beforeAfter">
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```java
import io.micronaut.validation.exceptions.ConstraintExceptionHandler;
public class ApiClientValidationExceptionHandler extends ConstraintExceptionHandler {
    ...
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```java
import io.micronaut.validation.exceptions.ConstraintExceptionHandler;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

public class ApiClientValidationExceptionHandler extends ConstraintExceptionHandler {

    @Inject
    public ApiClientValidationExceptionHandler(ErrorResponseProcessor errorResponseProcessor) {
        super(errorResponseProcessor);
    }
    ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Subclasses Returned From Factories Not Injectable**

It is no longer possible to inject the internal implementation type from beans produced via factories. The type returned from the factory or any of its supertypes are able to be injected.

<Tabs groupId="beforeAfter">
<TabItem value="before" label="Before">

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import javax.inject.Singleton;

public class ExecutorFactory {

    @Singleton
    public ExecutorService executorService() {
        return ForkJoinPool.commonPool();
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="after" label="After">

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import javax.inject.Singleton;

public class ExecutorFactory {

    @Singleton
    public ForkJoinPool executorService() {
        return ForkJoinPool.commonPool();
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Reflective Bean Map**

In several places in Micronaut, it is required to get a map representation of your object. In previous versions, a reflection based strategy was used to retrieve that information if the class was not annotated with `@Introspected`. That functionality has been removed and it is now required to annotate classes with `@Introspected` that are being used in this way. Any class may be affected if it is passed as an argument or returned from any controller or client, among other use cases.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="controller" label="Controller">

```java
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Post;

@Controller("/orders")
public class OrdersController {
    @Get("/order")
    public Order getOrder(Long orderId) {
        ...
        return order;
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="dto-before" label="Dto Before">

```java
public class Order {
    ...
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="dto-after" label="Dto After">

```java
import io.micronaut.core.annotation.Introspected;

@Introspected
public class Order {
    ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
