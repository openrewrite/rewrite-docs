# Running Rewrite on a Maven project without modifying the build

In this tutorial, we will apply a Rewrite [recipe](/concepts-and-explanations/recipes) to a source code repository built with Maven without modifying the build itself. The instructions for this differ slightly depending on whether or not the recipe has configuration parameters. Please note that you will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed in order to run the shell commands.

:::info
It is not possible to pass in configuration parameters from the command-line right now.
[Our frequently asked questions](/reference/faq#is-it-possible-to-update-only-a-few-files-with-a-recipe-rather-than-all-of-them) goes into more detail why not.

## Running a recipe without configuration parameters

If the recipe you're trying to run does not have any required configuration parameters, then you can run the recipe by executing a shell command.

:::tip
Our [recipe documentation](/recipes) includes the specific shell commands to run for any recipe without configuration parameters. You may find it easier to copy and run the provided command instead of manually creating it.
:::

If the recipe comes from the [core Rewrite library](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) (such as with [Remove Unused Imports](/recipes/java/removeunusedimports)) then you can run the following command and replace `org.openrewrite.java.RemoveUnusedImports` with the path to the recipe you're wanting to run: 

```shell
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run \
  -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.RemoveUnusedImports
```

If the recipe comes from a different library (such as with [Migrate to Jakarta EE 9](/recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/javaxmigrationtojakarta)) then you can run the following command and replace `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:LATEST` with the artifact coordinates of your recipe and `org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxMigrationToJakarta` with the path to the recipe you're wanting to run:

```shell
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run \
  -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:LATEST \
  -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxMigrationToJakarta
```

## Running a recipe with configuration parameters

If the recipe you're trying to run has configuration parameters, then you will need to:

1. [Create or update a `rewrite.yml` file in your project root](/running-recipes/getting-started#step-5-run-a-recipe-with-yaml-configuration). In there, you will need to create a new recipe that wraps the recipe you want to run and specifies the parameters you want to use.
2. Run a shell command that executes the new recipe you've defined in step 1.

For instance, if you wanted to run the [ChangePackage recipe](/recipes/java/changepackage) to change `org.old.package.name` to `org.new.package.name`, you would need to create a `rewrite.yml` file that looks like this: 

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.NameYouDefine
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.ChangePackage:
      oldPackageName: org.old.package.name
      newPackageName: org.new.package.name
```

You could then run that recipe by executing the following shell command:

```shell
mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run \
  -Drewrite.activeRecipes=com.yourorg.NameYouDefine
```
