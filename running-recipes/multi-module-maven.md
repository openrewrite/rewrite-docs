# Running OpenRewrite on a multi-module Maven project

If you have a Maven project with multiple modules, you may run into errors finding and running the [OpenRewrite Maven plugin](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-maven-plugin).

There is currently an [open issue](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-maven-plugin/issues/475) to better support multi-module Maven projects that you can +1 on if you'd like. 

In the meantime, one way to work around this is to add a profile on the parent POM:

```xml
<profile>
  <id>openrewrite</id>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.6</version>
        <configuration>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>org.openrewrite.java.cleanup.Cleanup</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
          <failOnDryRunResults>true</failOnDryRunResults>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</profile>
```

You can then run OpenRewrite from any submodule using this command: `mvn -Popenrewrite rewrite:run`.
