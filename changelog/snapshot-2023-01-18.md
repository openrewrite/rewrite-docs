## New Recipes
* [org.openrewrite.FindGitProvenance](/reference/recipes/findgitprovenance.md): List out the contents of each unique `GitProvenance` marker in the set of source files. When everything is working correctly, exactly one such marker should be printed as all source files are expected to come from the same repository / branch / commit hash. 
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.search.DependencyInsight](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/search/dependencyinsight): Find direct and transitive dependencies matching a group, artifact, and optionally a configuration name.Results include dependencies that either directly match or transitively include a matching dependency. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.recipes.FindRecipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/recipes/findrecipes): This recipe finds all OpenRewrite recipes, primarily to produce a data table that is being used to experiment with fine-tuning a large language model to produce more recipes.
