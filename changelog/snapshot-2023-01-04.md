# Snapshot (2023-01-04)

## New Recipes
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.AddDependency](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/adddependency): Add a gradle dependency to a `build.gradle` file in the correct configuration based on where it is used. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.UpgradeSpringBoot_2_0](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_0): Migrate applications built on Spring Boot 1.5 to the latest Spring Boot 2.0 release. This recipe will modify an application's build files, make changes to deprecated/preferred APIs, and migrate configuration settings that have changes between versions. This recipe will also chain additional framework migrations (Spring Framework, Spring Data, etc) that are required as part of the migration to Spring Boot 2.0.
