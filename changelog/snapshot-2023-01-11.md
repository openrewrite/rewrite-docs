# Snapshot (2023-01-11)

## New Recipes
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.EnableGradleBuildCache](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/enablegradlebuildcache): Enable the Gradle build cache. By enabling build cache the build outputs are stored externally and fetched from the cache when it is determined that those inputs have no changed, avoiding the expensive work of regenerating them. See the [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html) for more information. 
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.EnableGradleParallelExecution](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/enablegradleparallelexecution): Most builds consist of more than one project and some of those projects are usually independent of one another. Yet Gradle will only run one task at a time by default, regardless of the project structure. By using the `--parallel` switch, you can force Gradle to execute tasks in parallel as long as those tasks are in different projects. See the [Gradle performance documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/performance.html#parallel_execution) for more information. 
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.plugins.AddBuildPlugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/plugins/addbuildplugin): Add a Gradle build plugin to `build.gradle(.kts)`. 
* [org.openrewrite.gradle.plugins.AddSettingsPlugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/gradle/plugins/addsettingsplugin): Add a Gradle settings plugin to `settings.gradle(.kts)`. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.cleanup.CommonDeclarationSiteTypeVariances](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/cleanup/commondeclarationsitetypevariances): When using a method parameter like `Function<IN, OUT>`, it should rather be `Function<? super IN, ? extends OUT>`. This recipe checks for method parameters of well-known types. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.cleanup.DeclarationSiteTypeVariance](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/cleanup/declarationsitetypevariance): Currently, Java requires use-site type variance, so if someone has `Function<IN, OUT>` method parameter, it should rather be `Function<? super IN, ? extends OUT>`. Unfortunately, it is not easy to notice that `? super` and `? extends` is missing, so this recipe adds it where that would improve the situation. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.hibernate.MigrateToHibernate61](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/hibernate/migratetohibernate61): This recipe will apply changes commonly needed when migrating to Hibernate 6.1.x. The hibernate dependencies will   be updated to use the new org.hibernate.orm group ID and the recipe will make changes necessary to use Hibernate with Jakarta EE 9.0
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.hibernate.MigrateToHibernateDependencies61](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/hibernate/migratetohibernatedependencies61): This recipe will migrate any existing dependencies on Hibernate 5.x to the latest 6.1.x release. This migration will include the adjustment to the new `org.hibernate.orm` group ID. It accounts for artifacts names that both do and do not include the `jakarta` suffix and it will change both dependencies and managed dependencies.
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxAuthenticationMigrationToJakartaAuthentication](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/javaxauthenticationmigrationtojakartaauthentication): Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, necessitating a package relocation. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxAuthorizationMigrationToJakartaAuthorization](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/javaxauthorizationmigrationtojakartaauthorization): Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, necessitating a package relocation. 
* [org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxPersistenceXmlToJakartaPersistenceXml](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate/jakarta/javaxpersistencexmltojakartapersistencexml):  
* [org.openrewrite.java.spring.PropertiesToKebabCase](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/spring/propertiestokebabcase): Normalize Spring properties to use lowercase and hyphen-separated syntax. For example, changing `spring.main.showBanner` to `spring.main.show-banner`. With [Spring's relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding), `kebab-case` may be used in properties files and still be converted to configuration beans. Note, an exception to this is the case of `@Value`, which is match-sensitive. For example, `@Value("${anExampleValue}")` will not match `an-example-value`. [The Spring reference documentation recommends using `kebab-case` for properties where possible.](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding). 
* [org.openrewrite.maven.NormalizeMavenVariables](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/maven/normalizemavenvariables): Variables are all referenced by the prefix `project.`. You may also see references with `pom.` as the prefix, or the prefix omitted entirely - these forms are now deprecated and should not be used. 
* [org.openrewrite.maven.RemoveRepository](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/maven/removerepository): Removes a matching Maven repository. 

## Removed Recipes
* **org.openrewrite.gradle.search.EnableGradleParallelExecution**: Most builds consist of more than one project and some of those projects are usually independent of one another. Yet Gradle will only run one task at a time by default, regardless of the project structure. By using the `--parallel` switch, you can force Gradle to execute tasks in parallel as long as those tasks are in different projects. See the [Gradle performance documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/performance.html#parallel_execution) for more. 
* **org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxPeristenceXmlToJakartaPersistenceXml**:  
* **org.openrewrite.java.spring.YamlPropertiesToKebabCase**: Normalize Spring YAML properties to use lowercase and hyphen-separated syntax. For example, changing `spring.main.showBanner` to `spring.main.show-banner`. With [Spring's relaxed binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding), `kebab-case` may be used in properties files and still be converted to configuration beans. Note, an exception to this is the case of `@Value`, which is match-sensitive. For example, `@Value("${anExampleValue}")` will not match `an-example-value`. [The Spring reference documentation recommends using `kebab-case` for properties where possible.](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.6/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding) .
