            While we appreciate that you're attempting to improve the docs, please be aware that all files in the /reference/recipes directory are auto-generated by the [markdown-generator](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-recipe-markdown-generator).

            Please make changes to the recipes themselves rather than to these files. When the next release happens, these files will be updated accordingly.
